## Tokenomics are Broken
![Down_Only](/assets/down_only.png)

Today, project teams issue tokens to themselves and sell tokens to private investors (at low cost basis) in order to incentivize team members and raise funds, respectively. As these tokens unlock, investors rush to sell their tokens ahead of each other, creating a race to the bottom. This significant imbalance between supply and demand results in market instability and reduced investor confidence.

### Market Makers are Predatory
After launching a token, teams face the challenge of distributing these tokens to the public market. Teams often rely on market makers to provide liquidity and help facilitate smoother price discovery. To fund this endeavor, teams must provide market makers with a significant portion of the supply, giving them substantial influence over the token’s supply and demand.
This is problematic because market makers are profit-driven entities with operational costs. They have no obligation to support the token price and will engage in profitable trading strategies that oppose the interests of the markets they serve.

## A Better System

Technology has helped digitize many things that were once analog, clunky, and manual; capital markets are no different. Baseline trustlessly automates market functions traditionally operated by extractive third-parties.


Tokenomics today are analog and static.
- fixed supply
- third party rented liquidity
- 

The fundamental difference between Baseline and traditional market making strategies, is that Baseline’s key objective is to maximize value for its token holders. At a very high level, this is accomplished via two mechanisms:

1. On the buy-side, Baseline market making provides deep concentrated liquidity, which creates a rising floor price [BLV](concepts/blv) for the token. 
2. On the sell-side, Baseline market making provides continuous liquidity, allowing for constant price discovery.

In Baseline, any market making profits that accrue over time are redistributed back to token holders. Imagine a market maker whose sole objective is to distribute tokens in a fair and transparent manner, while supporting positive price development through a rising buy wall.

This kind of liquidity management is only possible because the entire token supply is minted and managed within Baseline’s programmatic market making system.
