## BLV: The Baseline Value

One of the most recognizable features of a Baseline Token is the distinctive yellow line on the chart,
representing the bToken's **Baseline Value (BLV)**: the guaranteed minimum price of a Baseline token.

{/* content fill: why is the BLV important to users? - known maximum downside when entering a trade, used as a
general hueristic for the amount of liquidity permanently accumulated by the system */}

The BLV is set by reserving enough liquidity in the pool to buy back the entire floating supply of the token. Put simply, 
the BLV is the price at which the last token could be sold if all holders exit.
This liquidity is locked and cannot be removed by anyone, including the team. This means the BLV can never decrease and 
only increases over time.

Baseline uses protocol-owned liquidity managed by smart contracts within Uniswap V3 concentrated positions to 
guarantee a bToken's BLV. This makes the BLV a directly redeemable value on the public market, unlike the 
estimated inaccessible book values commonly found in other protocols.

A bToken's BLV is calculated based on the highest price at which the system could buy back the entire 
token supply. Put differently, if every holder decided to sell their bTokens, the BLV is the price at which
the last token would be sold.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️"> 
  BLV price is denominated in the underlying liquidity token, called the ["reserve asset"](/resources/glossary#ra). 
  For example, if a bToken is paired with ETH, its BLV is priced in ETH, not USD. Therefore,  
  if ETH's price falls against USD, the bToken's BLV stays the same in ETH but drops in USD.
