## Market-Driven Token Issuance

While most tokens today operate on a fixed supply and predetermined emissions schedule, bTokens use a dynamic
issuance model. By not relying on a fixed supply, bTokens remain flexible and adaptive to their surrounding
market conditions. In Baseline, token supply is a function of liquidity, not the other way around.

When buyers deplete the supply of tokens on the market, Baseline will mint new bTokens directly into the 
liquidity pool to replenish any missing inventory. As these tokens are sold back, the protocol will burn 
any of the tokens collected in its liquidity positions. As a result, bTokens do not have a fixed supply cap; 
they grow and shrink in response to market demand.

Due to Baseline's market making, bTokens are more naturally resilient to common market manipulation. Tactics 
such as cornering the supply ("bundling"), spoofing volume, and pushing price in a specific direction now 
require significantly higher capital expenditure than for traditional tokens. As a result, bToken markets are
more authentic and honest than what you traditionally see on token screeners and centralized exchanges.

## The Solvency Invariant

By being the sole issuer of bTokens, Baseline also gains certain guarantees in its liquidity accounting: 
because bTokens cannot be minted externally, the protocol knows the circulating supply at any given time 
by discounting any bTokens inside its liquidity positions from the total supply.

To ensure that the liquidity structure remains solvent across rebalances, Baseline uses the invariant  
`Capacity > Circulating Supply`  to ensure that the liquidity structure can support the outstanding supply. 
In this invariant, `Capacity` is calculated as the total amount of bTokens purchasable across all the 
protocol-owned liquidity positions. `Circulating Supply` represents the total amount of sellable bTokens 
purchased by external parties.

  The `Circulating Supply` is not the total token supply of the contract; additional bTokens sitting 
  inside Baseline's liquidity positions are not counted in the supply, and therefore do not affect the total market cap 
  of the bToken.

The invariant is simple: check that the current configuration of the protocol's liquidity positions can 
buy back more than all of the tokens circulation. While basic, this one check is what keeps the Baseline 
system secure throughout its constantly changing liquidity positions and circulating supply.
