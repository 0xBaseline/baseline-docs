## Autonomous Market Making

Under the hood, the BLV is actually a side effect of a much larger system. Baseline is also a 
fully autonomous market making system, rebalancing bToken liquidity positions to passively capture 
value from market fluctuations over time. Each time a bToken is traded, Baseline accrues a small 
liquidity surplus, allowing the BLV to grow indefinitely.

Baseline's liquidity rebalances are unique in that they are _permissionlessly executed_: anyone is able 
to trigger a rebalance strategy, as long as the right liquidity conditions are met. This way, dynamic 
liquidity is an intrinsic property of bTokens, rather than a service provided by a third party.

## Intelligent Liquidity

Today, most on-chain liquidity is passively deployed as a single static liquidity position. 
This liquidity is often extremely inefficient and naively priced, requiring significant external 
capital to be effective. Most importantly, the structure does not allow for any flexibility, preventing
the liquidity from adapting to changing market conditions. 

Baseline uses a more sophisticated approach to liquidity management. Instead of a single static position,
the protocol dynamically allocates liquidity across multiple price ranges using four rebalancing strategies:
`sweep()`, `slide()`, `bump()`, and `drop()`. Each strategy impacts a different part of the liquidity 
structure and fulfills a specific purpose so that Baseline tokens can offer more resilient and efficient 
liquidity to their holders.

## Rebalancing Strategies

    **Purpose**  
    A `sweep()` builds up surplus capacity by accumulating liquidity. By moving liquidity from higher price 
    ranges downwards, `sweep()` enables Baseline to net buy more bTokens with the same amount of assets.

    **Condition**  
    A `sweep()` is called when the token price is trending upwards. More specifically, when the current price
    of the token has increased 2% into the Discovery liquidity position.
    
    **Description**  
    A `sweep()` adjusts the Anchor and Discovery price ranges to align more closely with the current 
    market price. This ensures that liquidity is optimally distributed in response to upward price movements.

  <Tabs.Tab>
    When the Floor can be moved higher the protocol calls: `bump()`

    **Description**  
    - A `bump()` operation shifts the highly concentrated liquidity within the Floor to a slightly higher price range. A `bump()` is a permanent change and cannot be reversed.

    **Condition**  
    - A `bump()` can be initiated when there is sufficient reserve capacity (e.g., ETH or USD) to purchase the entire floating supply at the new, elevated price point. This new price point is one [tick spacing](#tick-spacing0) above the current Floor.

    **Purpose**  
    - Make number go up.

  <Tabs.Tab>
    When the price is trending downwards the protocol calls: `slide()`

    **Description**  
    A `slide()` operation repositions the Anchor and Discovery price range closer to the market price when the price is trending downwards.

    {/*insert slide animation*/}

    **Purpose**  
    The primary goal of a `slide()` operation is to absorb sell pressure during downtrends. This is achieved by repositioning the Anchor price range closer to the Floor, allowing the market making system to absorb sell pressure at a discounted price. In addition, the liquidity in Anchor and Discovery is thinned out, allowing the price to recover more easily. 

    **Condition**  
    A `slide()` is initiated when the price of the token has decreased 2% from its last recorded checkpoint. 

    <Callout type="info" emoji="">
    Every `sweep()` and `slide()` operation updates the current price as the latest checkpoint.

    When the x can be moved lower the protocol calls: `drop()`

    **Description**  
    - A `drop()` operation shifts the highly concentrated liquidity within the x to a slightly lower price range. 

    **Condition**  
    - A `drop()` can be initiated when there is

    {/*insert drop animation*/}

    **Purpose**  
    - Make number go down.

#### Uniswap V3 Concepts

**Ticks**  
In Uniswap V3 pools, prices are determined using a system called ticks. Each tick represents a very small price increment (1 basis point or 0.01%). As an example, 100 ticks correspond to approximately a 1% change in price.

**Tick Spacing**  
Uniswap V3 pools use [tick spacing](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/21069524840589-What-is-a-tick-when-providing-liquidity) to define where liquidity can be allocated. The tick spacing spacing is determined by the pool's swap fee percentage. For example, a pool with a 1% swap fee has a tick spacing of 200. This means liquidity can only be allocated in increments of 200 ticks, which covers approximately a 2% price range.

In Baseline pools, the Floor price range is defined within one tick spacing. The BLV represents the lower bound of this tick spacing. When a `bump()` operation occurs in a 1% fee pool, the system will attempt to move the Floor price range one tick spacing higher (~2% higher). */}
