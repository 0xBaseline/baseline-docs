## Pre-Determined Token Issuance

In order for ease of integration, bTokens today operate on a fixed supply. By relying on a fixed supply, 
bTokens are more easily integrated into third party protocols and metrics reported by 3rd parties are able 
to be reported much more accurately. While token supply is fixed, circulating supply is dependent on market activity. 
In Baseline, the circulating token supply is a function of liquidity, not the other way around.


When buyers deplete the circulating supply of tokens on the market, Baseline will unlock bTokens directly into 
the liquidity pool to replenish any missing inventory. As these tokens are sold back, the protocol will remove any 
of the tokens collected in its liquidity positions from circulating supply. As a result, bTokens do have a fixed supply 
cap; but circulating supply can grow and shrink in response to market demand.


Due to Baseline's market making, bTokens are more naturally resilient to common market manipulation. Tactics such 
as cornering the supply ("bundling"), spoofing volume, and pushing price in a specific direction now require significantly 
higher capital expenditure than for traditional tokens. As a result, bToken markets are more authentic and reliable than 
what you traditionally see on token screeners and centralized exchanges.

## The Solvency Invariant

Since bTokens cannot be minted externally, the protocol knows the circulating supply at any given time. 

To ensure that the liquidity structure remains solvent across rebalances, Baseline uses the invariant `Capacity > Circulating Supply`. 
The invariant checks to make sure the liquidity in the pool can buy back all of the tokens in circulation.

- `Capacity` is calculated as the total amount of bTokens purchasable across all of the 
protocol-owned liquidity positions. 
- `Circulating Supply` represents the total amount of bTokens purchased from the liquidity pool.

<Callout>
  The `Circulating Supply` is net amount of tokens purchased from the protocol. Additional bTokens sitting 
  inside Baseline's liquidity positions are not counted in the supply, and therefore do not affect the total market cap 
  of the bToken.
</Callout>

The invariant is simple: check that the current configuration of the protocol's liquidity positions can 
buy back more than all of the tokens circulation. While basic, this single check is what keeps the Baseline 
system secure despite constant changes in liquidity positions and circulating supply.
