## Baseline Market Making

Under the hood, the BLV is a side effect of a much larger system. Baseline is also a 
fully autonomous market making system, rebalancing bToken liquidity positions to automatically capture 
value from market fluctuations over time. Each time a bToken is traded, Baseline accrues a small 
liquidity surplus, permanently growing the BLV.

Baseline's liquidity rebalances are unique in that they are handled by the protocol and _executed permissionlessly_: 
There's no  centralized market maker in charge of liquidity provisioning, the protocol market makes itself through 
smart contracts.


The key difference between Baseline and traditional market-making strategies is Baseline's focus on maximizing value for 
its token holders. It does this by providing deep liquidity on the buy side to create a rising floor price and continuous 
liquidity on the sell side for constant price discovery.

In Baseline, profits from market making are redistributed to token holders, ensuring fair token distribution and supporting 
positive price trends. This approach is possible because the entire token supply is minted and managed within Baseline’s automated 
market-making system.


### Protocol-Owned Liquidity Positions

{/* How BLV is derived, what does it actually mean? Lower bound of the floor range... */}

Baseline allocates liquidity across three distinct price ranges: Floor, Anchor, and Discovery. 

<Tabs items={['📈 Floor', '⚓️ Anchor', '🔎 Discovery']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
   ![floor](/assets/floor.png)

    The Floor is a narrow price range with highly concentrated liquidity. Its primary function is to ensure that 
    it can absorb the entire floating supply of a Baseline Token. Think of the Floor as a substantial buy wall 
    that allows every bToken holder to exit their position at the [Baseline Value (BLV)](/concepts).

    You may be wondering where the system sources the capital to guarantee the floor price. The liquidity is 
    sourced from the presale of the Baseline Token (bToken). Unlike traditional token launches, where presale 
    funds are typically distributed to the project team, Baseline token launches keep the liquidity in the market 
    making system. See the [presale](//launching#presale) section to learn how the initial liquidity is provisioned.


  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>

  ![anchor](/assets/anchor.png)

    The Anchor is a price range with lower liquidity depth compared to the Floor, but covers a broader price span. 
    Unlike the Floor which is designed to hold price, the Anchor is designed to encourage price discovery and support 
    trading activity. 

    The Anchor is a dynamic price range that is updated after a [liquidity rebalance](/concepts/dynamic_liquidity#rebalancing-strategies). 
    The Anchor occupies the price range from the market price and extends towards the Floor.


  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>

    ![discovery](/assets/discovery.png)

    The Discovery is a price range with thicker liquidity compared to the Anchor, and spans an even broader price range. 
    Similar to Anchor, the Discovery is a dynamic price range that is updated after a [liquidity rebalance](/concepts/dynamic_liquidity#rebalancing-strategies). 
    The Discovery occupies the price range from the market price and extends considerably higher. The Anchor and Discovery 
    were built with these liquidity profiles in order for the system to take profit during uptrends, and move these profits to the Floor in 
    order to initiate a `bump()`. This strategy is explained in greater detail in the [`sweep()`](/concepts/dynamic_liquidity#rebalancing-strategies) section.

{/* ### Metrics
- **System Capacity:** The total amount of bTokens that can be absorbed by the system’s reserve assets.
- **Floating Supply:** The total amount of bTokens outside of the system’s liquidity position a.k.a. the number of 
bTokens in the hands of potential sellers.

To ensure that all tokens can be redeemed at the BLV, Baseline asserts the condition that `capacity > floating supply` 
whenever liquidity is deployed.

### Identifying the BLV
To identify the BLV, Baseline calculates the highest price point at which it can deploy liquidity, while still meeting 
its solvency requirement (`capacity > floating supply`). 

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
Capacity is not limited to the Floor price range alone. Capacity can also include the reserve assets available in 
the Anchor and Discovery price ranges. These reserve assets absorb some of the floating supply, and are also taken into 
account when calculating the BLV. 
</Callout>

## Protocol Fees

The protocol generates fees in the following ways:

1. **LP fees** - token is deployed into a 1% Uniswap V3 pool, which means swaps pay 1% when swapping in/out of the pool. 
This fee goes directly to increasing the BLV. You can learn more about Uniswap fee tiers [here](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees).
2. **Liquidity rebalancing fees** - the protocol rebalances reserves from discovery into floor and anchor when `sweep()` is called. 
These reserves go toward increasing the BLV.
3. **Borrow fees** - users pay a one-time per-diem fee when they open or extend a borrow position. This fee goes directly to increasing the BLV. */}

{/* ## Team fees
During `sweep()` rebalancing, the protocol directs 10% of **surplus** capacity (in bAsset terms) to team multisig. */}

## Intelligent Liquidity

Today, most on-chain liquidity is passively deployed as a single static liquidity position. 
This liquidity is often extremely inefficient and naively priced, requiring significant external 
capital to be effective. Most importantly, the structure does not allow for any flexibility, preventing
the liquidity from adapting to changing market conditions. 

Baseline uses a more sophisticated approach to liquidity management. Instead of a single static position,
the protocol dynamically allocates liquidity across multiple price ranges using four rebalancing strategies:
`sweep()`, `slide()`, `bump()`, and `drop()`. Each strategy impacts a different part of the liquidity 
structure and fulfills a specific purpose so that Baseline tokens can offer more resilient and efficient 
liquidity to their holders.

## Rebalancing Strategies

<Callout emoji="">
<Tabs items={[ '➡️ Sweep', '⬆️ Bump', '⬅️ Slide', '⬇️ Drop']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    When the price is trending upwards the protocol calls: `sweep()`

    <video controls autoplay>
  <source src="/assets/Sweep_1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

    **Description**  
     A `sweep()` builds up surplus capacity by accumulating liquidity. By moving liquidity from higher price 
     ranges downwards, `sweep()` enables Baseline to net buy more bTokens with the same amount of assets. 
     
     A `sweep()` also adjusts the Anchor and Discovery price ranges to align more closely with the current market 
     price. This ensures that liquidity is optimally distributed in response to upward price movements.

    **Condition**  
    A `sweep()` is called when the token price is trending upwards. More specifically, when the 
    current price of the token has increased 2% into the Discovery liquidity position.

    **Purpose**  
    The `sweep()` operation provides a mechanism for the market making system to secure profits and build up surplus capacity. This is accomplished by selling tokens at a higher price and rebuying them for cheaper. 

    <Callout type="info" emoji="" >
    Every `sweep()` operation serves as a checkpoint, updating the `discovery tick` to the current price.
    </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>
 <Tabs.Tab>
    When the Floor can be moved higher the protocol calls: `bump()`

    <video controls autoplay>
  <source src="/assets/Bump.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

    **Description**  
    A `bump()` operation shifts the highly concentrated liquidity within the Floor to a slightly higher price range. 
    A `bump()` is a permanent change and cannot be reversed.

    **Condition**  
    A `bump()` can be initiated when there is sufficient reserve capacity (e.g., ETH or USD) to purchase the entire 
    floating supply at the new, elevated price point. This new price point is one tick spacing above the current Floor.

    **Purpose**  
    The `bump()` operation provides a mechanism for the market making system to increase the BLV, securing a higher token floor price. 
  </Tabs.Tab>
  
  <Tabs.Tab>
    When the price is trending downwards the protocol calls: `slide()`

     {/*insert slide animation*/}

    **Description**  
    A `slide()` operation repositions the Anchor price range around the market price when the price is trending downwards.

    **Condition**  
    A `slide()` is initiated when the price of the token has decreased 2% from its last recorded checkpoint. 


    **Purpose**  
    The slide() operation aims to absorb sell pressure during downtrends by repositioning the Anchor price range closer to 
    the Floor. This allows the market-making system to absorb sell pressure at a discounted price, while thinning out liquidity 
    in the Anchor, facilitating easier price recovery.
    
<Callout type="info" emoji="">
    Every `slide()` operation serves as a checkpoint, updating the `slide tick` to the current price.
    </Callout>
  </Tabs.Tab>

  <Tabs.Tab>
    When the Discovery price range can be moved lower the protocol calls: `drop()`

     {/*insert drop animation*/}

    **Description**  
    A `drop()` operation repositions the Discovery price range closer to the market price. 

    **Condition**  
    A `drop()` can be initiated once every 24 hours to reduce the distance between the last recorded `discovery tick` and the current market price by 20%.

    **Purpose**  
    The `drop()` operation repositions the Discovery range to a slightly lower price range following `slide()` operations. In addition, liquidity in the Discovery is thinned, allowing the price to recover more easily.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="">
    Every `drop()` operation serves as an update checkpoint for the `discovery tick`, placing it 20% below the previous checkpoint.

{/* #### Uniswap V3 Concepts

**Ticks**  
In Uniswap V3 pools, prices are determined using a system called ticks. Each tick represents a very small price increment (1 basis point or 0.01%). As an example, 100 ticks correspond to approximately a 1% change in price.

**Tick Spacing**  
Uniswap V3 pools use [tick spacing](https://support.uniswap.org/hc/en-us/articles/21069524840589-What-is-a-tick-when-providing-liquidity) to define where liquidity can be allocated. The tick spacing spacing is determined by the pool's swap fee percentage. For example, a pool with a 1% swap fee has a tick spacing of 200. This means liquidity can only be allocated in increments of 200 ticks, which covers approximately a 2% price range.

In Baseline pools, the Floor price range is defined within one tick spacing. The BLV represents the lower bound of this tick spacing. When a `bump()` operation occurs in a 1% fee pool, the system will attempt to move the Floor price range one tick spacing higher (~2% higher).  */}
