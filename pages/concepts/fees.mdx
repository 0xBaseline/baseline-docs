## Protocol Fees

The protocol generates fees in the following ways:

1. **LP fees** - token is deployed into a 1% Uniswap V3 pool, which means swaps pay 1% when swapping in/out of the pool. This fee goes directly to increasing the BLV. You can learn more about Uniswap fee tiers [here](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees).
2. **Liquidity rebalancing fees** - the protocol rebalances reserves from discovery into floor and anchor when `shift()` is called. These reserves go toward increasing the BLV.
3. **Borrow fees** - users pay a one-time per-diem fee when they open or extend a borrow position. This fee goes directly to increasing the BLV.

## Team fees
During `shift()` rebalancing, the protocol directs 10% of **surplus** capacity (in bAsset terms) to team multisig.
