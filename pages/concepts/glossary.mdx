## Glossary

**Afterburner**
A contract that allows protocols to use their earned fees to perform leveraged buybacks.

**Anchor**
Liquidity range consisting of both the bToken and the reserve asset; the tradable range.

**Backing**
The total amount of reserve assets in the Floor and the Anchor

**Baseline Token (bToken)**
ERC-20 token that is powered by Baseline’s tokenomics engine.

**Baseline Value (BLV)**
The up-only-price at which the protocol can buy back all circulating supply.

**Boost**
The act of borrowing a bToken without providing new collateral; boost is available when the BLV of a bToken increases, leading to an increase in borrowing capacity.

**Bump**
A ****market-making function that calculates at which price the protocol can buy back all of the existing supply and moves the BLV price up accordingly.

**Concentrated Liquidity**
Technology created by Uniswap that powers Baseline’s tokenomics engine; a series of programmable buy and sell orders placed across a price range.

**Credit Facility**
A ****contract that allows you to borrow the reserve asset at the BLV price.

**Default**
Forfeiting your bToken collateral by not repaying your loan.

**Discovery**
Liquidity range where unissued bTokens are sold for reserve assets to realize liquidity surpluses.

**Floor**
The total amount of reserve assets at the BLV price; total capacity at the BLV.

**Looping**
The act of borrowing the reserve asset to buy more bTokens, and then repeating that process.

**Reserve Asset**
ERC-20 token that a bToken is paired against, usually ETH, USD, or YES.

**Slide**
A market-making function that is called when the market price moves down 2%. It reduces the Discovery and Anchor capacity and moves them back to the current price.

**Sweep**
A market-making function called when the market price goes up 2%. It moves liquidity surpluses to the floor and increases the capacity for the Anchor and Discovery range.

**Ticks**
Ticks represent the boundaries between discrete areas in price space, with 1 tick indicating a 0.01% increase or decrease in price. Each tick space may have different liquidity depths configured.
