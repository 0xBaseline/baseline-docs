## Anchor
The Anchor is a price range with lower liquidity depth compared to the Floor, but covers a broader price span. Unlike the Floor which is designed to hold price, the Anchor is designed to encourage price movements and support trading activity.

The Anchor is a dynamic price range that is updated after a [liquidity rebalance](/concepts/market_making#rebalancing-liquidity). The Anchor occupies the price range from the market price and extends towards the Floor.
