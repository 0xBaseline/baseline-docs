## Discovery
The Discovery is a price range with thicker liquidity compared to the Anchor, and spans an even broader price range. Similar to Anchor, the Discovery is a dynamic price range that is updated after a [liquidity rebalance](/concepts/market_making#rebalancing-liquidity). The Discovery occupies the price range from the market price and extends considerably higher. The Anchor and Discovery were built with these liquidity profiles in order for the system to take profit during uptrends, and move these profits to the Floor in order to initiate a `bump()`. This strategy is explained in greater detail in the [`sweep()`](/concepts/market_making#rebalancing-liquidity) section.
