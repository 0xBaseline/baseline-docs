## Floor
The Floor is a narrow price range with highly concentrated liquidity. Its primary function is to ensure that it can absorb the entire floating supply of a Baseline Token. Think of the Floor as a substantial buy wall that allows every token holder to exit their position at the Floor price, also known as the [Baseline Value (BLV)](/concepts/blv).

Floating supply represents the amount of tokens purchased by external parties and NOT owned by the protocol. For example, a person who buys tokens from the protocol is swapping out Baseline tokens in exchange for the reserve asset. These Baseline tokens are introduced into the floating supply, and are backed by the reserve assets that now belong to the protocol.

You may be wondering where the system sources the capital to guarantee the floor price. The liquidity is sourced from the presale of the Baseline Token (bToken). Unlike traditional token launches, where presale funds are typically distributed to the project team, Baseline token launches keep the liquidity in the market making system. See the [presale](/launching#presale) section to learn how the initial liquidity is provisioned.
