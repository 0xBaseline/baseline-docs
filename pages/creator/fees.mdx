# Fees
bTokens generate trading fees through a dynamic fee mechanism. The bToken contract comes with a flexible fee routing, 
allowing you to direct fees to multiple destinations:
- Stakers - automatically distributed by Baseline to token stakers
- Creator
- Baseline Protocol
- Custom - roll your own contract and create custom reward mechanisms

By default, fees are collected in reserve asset (e.g. ETH) instead of bToken.

  A typical fee structure might look like:

  - 0% to custom address
  - 25% to creator wallet
  - 25% to Baseline protocol
