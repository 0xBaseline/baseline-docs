# Fees
bTokens generate trading fees with a dynamic fee mechanic that adjusts to market conditions. In addition, the bToken contract comes with a flexible fee routing, 
allowing you to direct fees to multiple destinations:
- Stakers - automatically distributed by Baseline to token stakers
- Creator
- Baseline Protocol
- Custom - roll your own contract and create custom reward mechanisms

By default, fees are collected in reserve asset (e.g. ETH) instead of bToken.

## Example
A typical fee structure might look like:
- 50% to stakers
- 0% to custom address
- 25% to creator's wallet
- 25% to Baseline protocol
