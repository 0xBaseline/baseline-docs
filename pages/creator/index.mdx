# Launch a token with superpowers

As a founder, creator, or even an AI agent, Baseline Factory lets you deploy a Baseline-powered token permissionlessly.

## Who is this for?
- **Creators** who want to avoid down only price chart, and have a token with utility from day one
- **Founders** looking for better tokenomics, supply emissions and/or value capture mechanics  
- **Projects** building internet-native products (Internet Capital Markets)
- **Launchpads** looking to differentiate in a saturated market

## What do I get?
Baseline tokens accomodate any tokenomics setup, including fair launches, presales, vesting terms and airdrops. We're compatible with any EVM chain, every 
bTokens come with a guaranteed price floor and dynamic liquidity managed by an algorithmic market maker. Token holders get access to interest-free loans, leverage without liquidation, and staking (soon ™)

In addition, btokens come with flexible fee mechanisms, allowing you to route fees to any address you want:
- Stakers - goes into Baseline's staking contract and is distributed
- Custom - roll your own contract and create custom reward mechanisms
- Creator
- Baseline Protocol

## Examples

### Example 1: Complex supply needs
You're a project creator that has investors & want to do an airdrop campaign. You still want Baseline Market Maker to manage your liquidity, guarantee a floor, etc. To accommodate your use case, here's how you'd use Baseline Factory:

1. Creator interacts with API that deploys token (not launched yet)
2. 20% of supply goes to liquidity = this is POL supply (non-circulating) that is managed by Baseline Market Maker
3. 80% of supply goes to Creator Address. Creator can then distribute tokens to vesting contract, ecosystem contract, airdrops contracts, etc
4. Creator spins up presale contract & transfers a portion of supply for a TGE (presale)
5. Presale ends & creator receives ETH from presale
6. BLV (floor price) is derived from amount of ETH added + POL supply. BMM performs accounting operations from this amount.

### Example 2: Loudio-style incentive mechanism
You're a project creator that wants to align trading volume to Yappers (Loudio derivative). Here's how you can do it:

1. Creator specifies 100% of fees go to Custom address
2. Custom address is a contract that is updated with Yapper leaderboard every epoch
3. As BMM collects 1% Uniswap fee, they are directed to Custom address and distributed accordingly.

## How do I do it?

### RESTful API 
Users can perform a POST request to https://api.baseline.markets/tokens which will deploy a token with specified parameters.

### Contract ABI
Users can interact with the Baseline Factory contract to deploy the token. */}
