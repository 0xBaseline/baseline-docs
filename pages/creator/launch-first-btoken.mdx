# Launch Your First bToken

This step-by-step guide will walk you through creating your first bToken using the Baseline Factory.

## Prerequisites

- Web3 wallet connected to Ethereum mainnet
- ETH for gas fees (recommended: 0.01 ETH)
- Basic understanding of token economics

## Step 1: Access the Baseline Factory

1. Navigate to the [Baseline Factory](https://app.baseline.com/factory)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Ensure you're on Ethereum mainnet

## Step 2: Configure Basic Parameters

### Token Details
- **Token Name**: Choose a memorable name for your token
- **Token Symbol**: 3-5 letter symbol (e.g., "MYTKN")
- **Initial Supply**: Total tokens to mint initially
- **Decimals**: Usually 18 (standard for ERC-20)

### BLV Parameters
- **Initial Price Floor**: Minimum price your token can trade at
- **Liquidity Depth**: How much liquidity to provide initially
- **Spread Parameters**: Bid/ask spread configuration

## Step 3: Review and Deploy

1. Review all parameters carefully
2. Check gas estimation
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
4. Wait for deployment confirmation

## Step 4: Verify Your Token

After deployment:
1. Copy your token's contract address
2. Verify it on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io)
3. Test a small trade to ensure liquidity is working

## Default Parameters

If you're unsure about parameters, here are safe defaults:

- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 tokens
- **Price Floor**: $0.10
- **Liquidity Depth**: $10,000
- **Spread**: 2% (1% bid, 1% ask)

## What You'll Need
- **Token name and symbol**
- **Address to control the fee split (owner address)**
- **Starting price and premium**

Once set up, head to [launch.baseline.markets](https://launch.baseline.markets). Presale participants can be added before the token goes live.

## After Launch
Trading begins once the presale liquidity is sent to the pool. From there:
- Liquidity rebalances are automatic
- Floor price grows with volume
- You and your community benefit from every trade

You can always adjust your token page, add staking, or integrate with launchpads later.

## Next Steps

Once your token is live:
- Share it with your community
- Consider staking YES tokens to boost performance
- Monitor trading activity
- Learn about custom parameters for your next token

## Troubleshooting

**High Gas Fees**: Try deploying during off-peak hours
**Transaction Fails**: Ensure you have enough ETH for gas
**Token Not Appearing**: Refresh the page and check your wallet
