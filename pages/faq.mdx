# FAQ

## Introduction:

**What is Baseline?**

- Baseline is a tokenomics engine with features that keep values within the token itself. It revolutionized how tokens launch and reach maturity.

___

**What is BLV?**

- BLV, or Baseline Value, is the guaranteed floor price for a Baseline token, ensuring that the token always has a minimum value.

___

**What does the BLV do?**

- BLV protects token value by guaranteeing that the token can always be sold at or above a certain price, even in volatile market conditions.

___

**What does Baseline’s market making do?**

- Baseline’s market making automates liquidity management, ensuring that there’s always enough liquidity to support the token’s price.

___

**What is Baseline lending?**

- Baseline lending allows users to borrow against their tokens without the risk of liquidation, using the token’s intrinsic value(BLV) as collateral.

___

**What is Baseline looping facility?**

- The Baseline looping facility allows traders to leverage/deleverage their positions without the risk of liquidation.

___

**What is Afterburner?**

- Afterburner is a randomized leveraged buy-back and burn mechanism within Baseline. It uses leverage to repurchase tokens from the market and then burns them, reducing the overall supply and increasing the value of the remaining tokens.

___

**What is the total supply of the baseline token?**

- The total supply of the Baseline token is determined by the system based on predefined conditions, which are tied to the project's growth and performance to maintain balance and solvency.

___

**What is the FDV of a Baseline token?**

- At Baseline, FDV and market cap are the same because the total supply of tokens is fully circulating, with no hidden or locked tokens. This transparency ensures that the market cap accurately reflects the entire value of the token supply, making FDV and market cap identical.

___

**What makes Baseline tokens different from other tokens?**

- Baseline stands out by automating market making, providing a guaranteed price floor, and allowing for liquidation free loans and leveraged positions. These features ensure stability and long-term growth, making it a unique and innovative solution in the tokenomics space.

___

**Can tokens in Baseline still experience significant price drops?**

- While Baseline provides a guaranteed floor price (BLV) to protect against extreme losses, token prices can still fluctuate above the floor based on market demand. However, the system is designed to minimize severe drops by ensuring liquidity and stabilizing token value.

___

**Who should consider using Baseline?**

- Baseline is ideal for traders looking for a secure environment to trade tokens, project founders who want to ensure the long-term success of their tokens, and early investors seeking protection from volatility. It’s a system designed for those who prioritize stability, transparency, and sustainable growth.

## Questions From Project Founders

**How is the process different than launching a regular token?**

- Launching a Baseline token is automated and designed to protect your project’s value. Unlike traditional launches, you don’t need to manually manage liquidity or find a market maker with potentially toxic terms. Baseline’s system handles these aspects for you, allowing you to focus on building your project.

___

**What are some things I need to prepare?**

- The goal of Baseline is to let you focus on building a great product while worrying less about the complexities of token management. To prepare for launching a Baseline token, you’ll need to define your project’s goals, determine the proportion of tokens for private and public sales, and understand your liquidity needs. The Baseline system will handle the rest, ensuring that your token’s value is protected and aligned with your project’s long-term success. Completing a due diligence questionnaire will help us tailor the system to your specific needs, so you can stay focused on what matters most—building an amazing product.

___

**How is Baseline’s market making different than traditional market making?**

- Baseline’s market making ensures that the value your token generates stays within your project. Unlike traditional market makers, who may extract value, Baseline’s automated system keeps your token’s value locked in, directly benefiting your project and community.

___

**How is the presale going to work?**

- We generally recommend a public bootstrap that’s open to communities. With Baseline, you gain access to an existing community and more flexibility in your presale methods, thanks to our partnerships with various launchpads. This approach lets you tailor the presale to your project’s specific needs while reaching a broader audience.

___

**What do I need to sacrifice to be a Baseline token?**

- The system controls 100% of your token supply, so early private rounds need to stay proportionate to the total amount you're raising. This ensures steady floor price growth, protecting your project’s value. You have the flexibility to adjust this, but the floor may grow slower depending on your choices.

___

**How does the system know when to print new tokens?**

- The system mints new tokens based on predefined conditions tied to your project's growth and performance. When liquidity and demand metrics reach certain thresholds, new tokens are printed to maintain balance and ensure the protocol remains solvent.

___

**As my project grows bigger, does it take more capital to move the price?**

- Yes, as your project grows and more capital is locked in, it takes more capital to move the price. Baseline’s liquidity model ensures a stable and sustainable price floor, protecting your token’s value as it scales.

___

**How much can I raise for my private round?**

- The amount you can raise depends on your operational needs, how it aligns with your public sale, and expected post-launch volume. If you're unsure, we're here to help. Fill out our due diligence questionnaire and book a call with us to find the best solution.

___

**Seems complicated and novel, how do I convince my investors?**

- Baseline might seem complex at first glance, but that’s part of its strength. It’s designed to protect and grow the project’s value in ways that traditional methods can’t. The system guarantees a price floor, ensuring that the token’s value is always safeguarded, even in challenging market conditions. Baseline also automates liquidity management and aligns investor rewards with the project's success, significantly reducing common risks. Case studies from other projects have shown impressive results. This isn’t just another crypto venture; it’s a groundbreaking approach that positions the project as a leader in the space, offering a safer and more promising investment for the long term.

## Questions From Angels/Investors

**As an angel investor: how are baseline tokens better a regular crypto token investment?**

- As an early investor in a Baseline token, you gain unique, liquidation free leveraged positions tied to the project's growth. This means your potential gains increase with the project’s success, offering both protection through a price floor and alignment with long-term value creation.

___

**What is growth-based vesting?**

- Growth-based vesting in Baseline rewards investors based on a project's success, giving them higher potential gains that grow with the project's achievements, rather than just unlocking tokens over time.

___

**What does it look like to invest in a Baseline token as early investor?**

- Generally the same process, except the pay out structure is more preferable among investors. Unlike conventional methods where tokens gradually unlock over time, growth-based vesting in Baseline offers investors unique liquidation free leveraged positions that amplify their potential gains while aligning with the project's long-term vision.

___

**What key factors should I focus on when evaluating a Baseline token investment to determine if it's a strong project?**

- With Baseline eliminating many common issues around token distribution, you can focus on the real potential of the project. Prioritize high-volume and liquidity potential, strong Afterburner revenue, clear project maturity, innovative offerings, and product market fit. These factors indicate a project's true growth potential.

___

**How is growth-based vesting better than time-based vesting?**

- Growth-based vesting is better than time-based vesting because it aligns investor rewards with the actual success of the project, not just the passage of time. This approach motivates all stakeholders to focus on long-term growth, ensuring that rewards increase as the project thrives, rather than unlocking on a fixed schedule regardless of performance.

___

**Can I exit my position anytime?**

- Investors can exit their position, but to profit, the token price needs to be higher than their leveraged position. This ensures that exits are tied to the project’s growth and success, aligning rewards with performance.

___

**Does the loop position ever gets expired?**

- Depending on your terms, projects can set an expiry date on your position, but it’s not required. If there’s no expiry date, your position remains active as long as the project continues to grow and maintain its value. This flexibility allows for tailored investment strategies that align with both the project’s and the investor’s goals.

___

**What are some risks with growth-based vesting?**

- While growth-based vesting aligns rewards with a project’s success, there are some risks to consider. If the project doesn’t perform as expected, your returns could be lower than with traditional vesting. However, unlike traditional vesting where you might struggle to sell in an illiquid pool, Baseline ensures that you can always exit through the floor price, providing a safety net for your investment.

___

**If a project underperforms, how does that affect my investment in Baseline tokens?**

- If a project underperforms, your returns might be lower compared to more successful projects. However, Baseline's price floor ensures that your investment is protected from the extreme losses often seen in traditional crypto investments, giving you a level of security even in less favorable scenarios.

{/* ## OLD FAQ TO INTEGRATE OR MAKE ADVANCED SECTION
## General FAQ

**How does Baseline differ from YES?**

- Baseline is an innovative automated tokenomics engine for ERC20 tokens, while YES is the first token launched on Baseline.  

_____

**What is the YES token supply and where can I see current supply?**

- Token supply is dynamic and based on the buys/sells in LP, `token supply = total supply - POL`. The current supply is able to be viewed on the Dapp or via  `getCirculatingSupply` function in the contracts.  

_____

**Did the team get an allo or are they also aping?**

- There is no team allocation, no VC allocation, no LP incentives allocation.
All supply is minted into the uniswap pool, and must be bought. 

_____

**How is the market cap of YES calculated?**

-  `MC = circ_supply * market_price`

## Market Making FAQ


**The BLV really can’t go down? It sounds too good to be true.**

- The Baseline system is ETH denominated. In ETH terms, the BLV is not able to decrease in value. The dollar price of ETH is a variable outside of the control of this protocol, and therefore when viewing charts in dollar terms you may see discrepancies that are not present on the ETH based charts. 

- TLDR: BLV backed by ETH, so in ETH terms, BLV is UpOnly™ 

_____

**If the protocol is buying at a premium to BLV, how can it remain solvent?**

- Baseline rebalances liquidity in such a way that the amount of reserves acquired selling tokens at a premium will always exceed the amount of reserves used to buyback tokens. This inequality ensures that the protocol will always have reserves on hand to buy every circulating token.

_____

**How much can the BLV increase by?**

- It's impossible to say how much the BLV can increase by, but it's useful to consider factors that influence it. BLV increases when the protocol realizes profitability from LPing, liquidity rebalancing, and borrows. The more price discovery there is, the more rebalancing there is, the more reserves are pulled into floor which adds to protocol's profitability.

_____

**Why is the Anchor Position needed?**

- The Anchor Position is needed because it helps the protocol make profits. It allows the protocol to sell tokens at a higher price than its safety net, which is the price floor. However, it also comes with a risk: if the protocol buys tokens at a higher price, it can reduce profitability. So, the Anchor Position is a balance between making profits and taking some risks in the trading process.

_____

**What happens if third-parties provide liquidity?**

- Given the permissionless nature of Uniswap protocol, there is nothing preventing third-parties from providing liquidity to the pair. This liquidity, however, will be independent of Baseline contracts and will not accrue to protocol. Protocol accounting and profitability will not affected by third-party liquidity, either. That's because to become a third-party LP, one must first acquire Baseline token from the protocol.

_____

**What actually triggers rebalancing?**

- `sweep()` , `slide()`, and `bump()` in MarketMaking.sol are responsible for rebalancing and can be called by anyone. Practically, we expect on-chain keepers to call the rebalances.

_____

**What’s the difference between a `sweep()` , `slide()`, and `bump()`?**

- `sweep()` , `slide()`, and `bump()` are all market-making functions called at different points relative to price action. 

- `sweep()` is called when the market price goes up 2%. It moves liquidity surpluses to the floor and increases the capacity for the Anchor and Discovery range.
- `slide()`is called when the market price moves down 2%. It reduces the Discovery and Anchor capacity and moves them back to the current price.
- `bump()` calculates at which price the protocol can buy back all of the existing supply and moves the BLV price up accordingly.

_____

**Is rebalancing liquidity based on premium done externally or every swap?**

- Rebalancing is done externally.

_____

**What's the new risk introduced with the hole and relying on external LP providers?**

- The risk is high slippage near floor, there is still capacity at the BLV to absorb all token sells.

_____

**What percent of swap fees and loan fees get directed to afterburner?**

- The afterburner receives all LP fees and interest fees.

_____

**How often does the afterburner trigger? Is it manual?**

- The afterburner can be publicly triggered. There is a configurable cooldown period and it will burn off a percentage of the assets that it has every couple minutes. A forever TWAP. Volume builds it up, looping builds it up, and it runs off into the pool. And then we keep trading. 

_____

**Basically the after burner uses the ETH to buy YES and the protocol owns that YES?**

- Yes. 

- And then the protocol leverage loops that YES, and then defaults it. Acting as a counterbalance to supply expansion and increasing backing for all. Yes.

## Credit Facility FAQ

**Can I be liquidated?**

- There are no price based liquidations. Since every token is backed by reserves at the Baseline Value, the protocol doesn't need to manage a liquidation engine, meaning the protocol doesn't seize borrowers' assets. 

- **Your loan can, however, expire and default.** In the event of a default (due to expiry), the protocol simply burns the collateral, reducing the circulating supply and reserves at a ratio that grows the intrinsic value.

_____

**What's the advantage of looping?**

- Looping provides leveraged exposure to YES. If the price of YES increases, then you’d be able to realize this increase across the looped position. Additionally, as the BLV increases, you’re able to Boost your position to pull out the equity gained in the position. 

_____

**What are the risks of looping?**

- The risks to looping are that you have leveraged exposure to YES. If you bought or looped at a premium, there is the risk that price can go down relative to your purchase price. You are also at risk of losing additional collateral in the event of loan expiration.

_____

**I took out a second loan, why am I only seeing one loan on the site?**

- All loans + loops are displayed as one position. Any additional borrows or extensions are applied to this position. You have one expiration date, adding to this extension applies to the position as a whole.

_____

**How is it possible that loans can't be liquidated and the protocol remains solvent?**

- Loans cannot be liquidated by price movement. Since each YES token is backed by a Baseline Value, and this value is what is lent out when a loan is obtained, the protocol always has enough reserves to buy back all tokens at this price. While loans cannot be liquidated, they will default if they are not paid back prior to expiration. 

_____

**What happens if I don't pay back my loan in time?**

- **You MUST either extend or repay your loan prior to expiration.** Failure to do so will result in the loan defaulting, the collateral will automatically be programmatically burnt by the contract**. 

- There is nothing the team can do to recover defaulted loans. Please add a reminder in your phone or calendar about your loan so that you have ample time to extend or repay prior to expiration. 

_____

**Can I extend my loan, if I want to?**

- Yes, you may extend you loan at any time **prior to expiration**. You can choose the length of your loan. Keep in mind that this extension will apply to any future loops/additions to the loan. 

_____

**Is there a capacity on how much the protocol can lend out?**

- The ultimate capacity of the protocol can lend out is 100% of the reserves, meaning the total backed value of all Baseline tokens in circulation.

_____

**Why is the origination fee so high when other lending markets charge less?**

- The origination fee is a fixed, one-time fee unlike traditional lending markets that charge an annualized interest rate that changes with market demand. It can also be thought of as the privilege of accessing liquidity no matter market conditions.
