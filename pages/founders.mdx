## The Problem

![down_only](/assets/down_only.png)


### Launching a Good Token is Hard 
After launching a token, teams face the challenge of distributing these tokens to the public market. Teams 
often rely on market makers to provide liquidity and help facilitate smoother price discovery. To fund this endeavor, 
teams must provide market makers with a significant portion of the supply, giving them substantial influence over the token’s 
supply and demand.
This is problematic because market makers are profit-driven entities with operational costs. They have no obligation to support 
the token price and will engage in profitable trading strategies that oppose the interests of the markets they serve.

## A Better System

Baseline was created in direct response to the exploitative practices that market participants are forced to endure. 
Baseline aims to establish markets where transparency and fairness are hard requirements, and built-in at the technological level. 
The goal is to change the underlying mechanisms and align market participants towards shared, long-term value creation.

### Token Distribution
Baseline leverages Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity to create unique market dynamics for its tokens. At launch, the 
system deploys the majority of the token supply into the liquidity pool, eliminating the need for independent market makers 
to provide liquidity. This ensures that tokens are always available for purchase, and allows for continuous price discovery.

With Baseline, market making profits are reinvested to support a higher floor price over time, benefiting all token holders 
rather than being extracted by external parties. The system also uses [innovative automated strategies](/concepts/dynamic_liquidity) 
to rebalance liquidity, improving market stability and efficiency.
