## Borrowing Against Your Tokens


### Unlock Liquidity Without Selling

Baseline allows you to borrow against your bTokens at 0% interest, using the protocol’s floor value 
(BLV) as collateral. This gives you access to liquidity without needing to sell your position or risk liquidation.

### How It Works
- Each bToken has a BLV (floor price), backed by the reserves.
- You can borrow a percentage of your token’s floor value directly from the protocol.
- Loans are non-liquidatable and interest-free.
- You can repay anytime to restore full exposure.


### Why It’s Useful
- Access capital without selling
- No liquidation risk
- Maintain exposure to future upside


This is ideal for users who want to free up liquidity for other purposes — like joining a new presale, 
rotating into another token, or holding stablecoins — without exiting their current position.
