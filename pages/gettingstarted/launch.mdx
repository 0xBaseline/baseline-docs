## Launching Your First bToken

### Start with Stronger Foundations

**Baseline lets you launch and sustain a token without needing market makers, manual interventions, 
or extractive liquidity setups.**

Baseline handles the hard parts, real-time market making, spread optimization, and capital-efficient flow  
so you can focus on building your product and community.

### What Youâ€™ll Need
- **Token name and symbol**
- **Address to control the fee split (owner address)**
- **Starting price and premium**

Once set up, head to [launch.baseline.markets.](https://launch.baseline.markets) Presale participants can be added before the token goes live.

### After Launch
Trading begins once the presale liquidity is sent to the pool. From there:
- Liquidity rebalances are automatic
- Floor price grows with volume
- You and your community benefit from every trade

You can always adjust your token page, add staking, or integrate with launchpads later.
