## Leveraging with Loops


### Amplify Exposure by Re-Buying with Borrowed Funds

Looping lets you borrow against your bToken, then use that borrowed liquidity to buy more of the same 
token — increasing your exposure and growing your floor position.

It’s a way to go leveraged long without liquidation risk.


### How It Works
- Borrow against your bToken’s BLV.
- Use the borrowed funds to buy more bTokens.
- Repeat to compound your position.

Each loop adds buy pressure and increases BLV, benefiting both you and the broader holder base.


### Key Differences from Borrowing
- Borrowing gives you liquidity without selling.
- Looping uses that liquidity to re-enter the market — amplifying gains (and risks).


There’s no liquidation, but the token price still matters: looping increases exposure, so you're still 
affected by market movement.
