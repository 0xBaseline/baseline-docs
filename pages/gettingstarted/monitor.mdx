## Monitoring Token Performance


### Understand What Drives Price, Floor, and Volume

Baseline tokens include more than just a market price — they have a built-in floor (BLV), 
dynamic liquidity structure, and trading volume that impacts rewards and market behavior.

Knowing how to read these metrics helps you make better decisions.


### Key Metrics to Watch
- Market Price – The current trading price based on protocol liquidity.
- BLV (Baseline Value) – The guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves.
- Premium – The % difference between market price and BLV. A high premium signals demand and may trigger BLV bumps.
- Volume – Drives rewards and BLV growth. More volume = more system value.
- Utilization – How much buffer liquidity the protocol is using. Higher utilization = more aggressive market-making.
