## Staking and Earning Rewards


### Put Your Tokens to Work

Baseline introduces protocol-native staking that lets bToken holders earn rewards directly 
from trading activity — no separate apps or wrappers required.

When you stake a bToken, you’re not providing liquidity or taking price exposure — you’re 
simply temporarily locking your tokens to earn a share of trading fees.


### How It Works
- Protocol fees from trading and borrowing are collected into a reward pool.
- Stakers earn a proportional share of these fees based on how much they’ve staked.
- Rewards accumulate over time and can be claimed or restaked at any time.


### Key Benefits
- No impermanent loss – You’re not LPing, so there’s no exposure to losses resulting from your 
token ratios being auto-rebalanced. 
- Passive yield – Earn from protocol activity without active management.
- Aligned with volume – The more a token is traded, the more rewards are generated.


### Coming Soon
Staking is being rolled out gradually across bTokens. You can check whether a token supports 
staking by visiting its page on [app.baseline.markets.](https://app.baseline.markets)
