## Trading Your First bToken


### What to Expect When Participating in Baseline Market

Baseline tokens (bTokens) trade just like any other token — but the mechanics under the hood work differently.

When you buy a bToken, you’re not trading against another user. You’re trading against the protocol’s automated 
liquidity engine. That engine adjusts price based on volume and flow, while storing a portion of liquidity at 
the **BLV (Baseline Value)** — the guaranteed minimum price floor.


### What Makes bToken Trading Different?
- **Visible floor price** – Every bToken has a public, on-chain minimum price. You can always exit at 
this floor, even if no one else is buying.
- **Price impact depends on volume** – Buying pushes price up, selling pushes it down. But the floor ensures 
the price doesn’t collapse.
- **Fees grow the system** – The trading fee of each trade goes toward the stakers.


### What You’ll Need
To trade a bToken, all you need is:
- A supported wallet (e.g. Rabby)
- Native gas token (e.g. ETH) for transactions
- USDC or ETH to buy the bToken, depending on the market


### Where to Start
