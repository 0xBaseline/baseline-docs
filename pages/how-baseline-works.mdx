# How Baseline Works

Baseline is a decentralized protocol that creates autonomous liquidity engines for tokens. Here's how it works:

## BLV (Baseline Liquidity Vault)

The BLV is the core component that manages liquidity for each bToken. It:

- Maintains a price floor through protocol-owned liquidity
- Automatically adjusts bid/ask spreads based on market conditions
- Provides continuous liquidity without relying on external market makers

## Liquidity Engine

The autonomous liquidity engine:

- Uses PID control loops to modulate spreads
- Maintains inventory ratios that prevent manipulation
- Creates reflexive price discovery through coordinated trading

## Looping

Looping allows users to:

- Amplify their exposure to bTokens through leverage
- Earn yield through staking and borrowing mechanisms
- Participate in the protocol's growth through YES token incentives

## Key Mechanics

### Price Floor Protection
Every bToken has a built-in price floor (BLV) that prevents the token from falling below a certain value, providing stability and confidence to holders.

### Liquidity Skew
The protocol shapes bid/ask spreads to encourage desired trading behavior while maintaining market efficiency.

### Reflexive Supply/Demand
Token supply and demand are interconnected through staking mechanisms, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem.
