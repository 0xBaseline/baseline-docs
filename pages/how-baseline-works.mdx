## How Baseline Works
Most tokens still rely on external market makers to keep trading alive, systems that are often opaque, 
extractive, and prone to failure during volatility. 

Baseline tokens (or bTokens) are ERC-20 tokens with superpowers. Every bToken come with a guaranteed price floor and dynamic liquidity managed by an algorithmic market maker. 
These superpowers unlock immediate utility with interest-free loans, leverage without liquidation, and staking (soon â„¢).

- [BLV](/theory/blv) - a minimum price that is always backed by on-chain liquidity
- [BMM](/theory/bmm) - an algorithmic market maker that provides continuous liquidity and price discovery
- [Loans & Leverage](/theory/loans_leverage) - access capital without selling
