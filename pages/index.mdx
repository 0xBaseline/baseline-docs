## Introduction

_Infinite, unruggableâ„¢ liquidity._

Baseline is an automated tokenomics engine for ERC20 tokens. By utilizing a dynamic supply model and a basic market making strategy, Baseline gives new ERC20s persistent, on-chain liquidity and non-liquidatable leverage right out of the box.

When a Baseline token is deployed, it automatically seeds initial liquidity into a Uniswap V3 pool. At launch, 100% of token supply is kept on-chain by the protocol and used to protect their value forever.
