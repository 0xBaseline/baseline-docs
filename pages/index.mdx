## Welcome to Baseline

The Baseline Protocol deploys and issues Baseline Tokens (bTokens), a programmable asset class with 
built-in liquidity. Unlike most tokens, Baseline controls its own market making operations and can maintain a unique 
liquidity structure that helps facilitate positive price development. Baseline's automated tokenomics system and a novel 
liquidity accounting strategy provides bTokens with a unique set of features, such as:

- [A guaranteed floor price](/concepts)
- [A dynamic liquidity profile](/concepts/dynamic_liquidity)
- [An automated buyback & burn](/concepts/afterburner)
- [Native lending and borrowing](/utility/loans)
- [Liquidation-free leverage](/utility/loops)

and more!
