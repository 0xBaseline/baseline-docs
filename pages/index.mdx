## Introduction

Baseline is a decentralized protocol that leverages Uniswap V3 technology to manage the liquidity and pricing of ERC20 tokens. By employing smart contracts to execute a basic market making strategy, Baseline eliminates the need for traditional market makers. Since the token controls its own market making operations, it can maintain a unique liquidity structure that helps facilitate positive price development.

The fundamental difference between Baseline and traditional market making strategies is that Baseline’s key objective is to maximize value for its token holders. At a very high level, this is accomplished via two mechanisms:

1. On the buy-side, Baseline market making provides deep concentrated liquidity, which creates a rising floor price [BLV] for the token. 
2. On the sell-side, Baseline market making provides continuous liquidity, allowing for constant price discovery.

In Baseline, any market making profits that accrue over time are redistributed back to token holders. Imagine a market maker whose sole objective is to distribute tokens in a fair and transparent manner, while supporting positive price development through a rising buy wall.

This kind of liquidity management is only possible because the entire token supply is minted and managed within Baseline’s programmatic market making system.

## The Problem

Tokenomics and liquidity management are critical to a token’s success. Poor design and execution in these areas will hinder token growth. Despite their importance, innovation has largely been stagnant. As more tokens are launched, it is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional models around tokenomics and distribution are inherently flawed.

### Poor Tokenomics (Project Teams and Investors)
Today, project teams issue tokens to themselves and sell tokens to private investors (at low cost basis) in order to incentivize team members and raise funds, respectively. As these tokens unlock, investors rush to sell their tokens ahead of each other, creating a race to the bottom. This significant imbalance between supply and demand results in market instability and reduced investor confidence.

### Bad Token Distribution (Market Makers)
After launching a token, teams face the challenge of distributing these tokens to the public market. Teams often rely on market makers to provide liquidity and help facilitate smoother price discovery. To fund this endeavor, teams must provide market makers with a significant portion of the supply, giving them substantial influence over the token’s supply and demand.
This is problematic because market makers are profit-driven entities with operational costs. They have no obligation to support the token price and will engage in profitable trading strategies that oppose the interests of the markets they serve.

## A Better System

Baseline was created in direct response to the exploitative practices that market participants are forced to endure. Baseline aims to establish markets where transparency and fairness are hard requirements, and built-in at the technological level. The goal is to change the underlying mechanisms and align market participants towards shared, long-term value creation.

### Tokenomics
In Baseline, all tokens are minted and distributed to investors at time of launch without any vesting schedules, thereby removing any supply overhang. Baseline mitigates the risks associated with early investor sell-offs by ensuring that there is sufficient liquidity to maintain a guaranteed [floor price](/concepts/blv). This provides a stable exit point for all token holders, and builds confidence in investors by having transparent downside risk.

### Token Distribution
Baseline leverages Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity to create unique market dynamics for its tokens. At launch, the system deploys the majority of the token supply into the liquidity pool, eliminating the need for independent market makers to provide liquidity. This ensures that tokens are always available for purchase, and allows for continuous price discovery.

With Baseline, market making profits are reinvested to support a higher floor price over time, benefiting all token holders rather than being extracted by external parties. The system also uses [innovative automated strategies](/concepts/market_making) to rebalance liquidity, improving market stability and efficiency.

## Who Should Care About Baseline?

### Project Teams
Designing tokenomics and managing token distribution for long-term success is an incredibly complex task fraught with pitfalls. Teams end up designing unsustainable tokenomics and agreeing to unfavorable terms with market makers. Navigating these challenges takes time and energy that could be better spent building products–and even then often result in suboptimal outcomes.

Baseline offers a streamlined solution that eliminates the need for traditional market makers and has an automated approach to liquidity and pricing. Project teams can concentrate on product development knowing that the system will manage token distribution and market making efficiently and fairly.

### Investors
Baseline tokens offer several compelling features for investors to consider:

1. Baseline tokens are secured with a floor value, protecting investors from significant losses.
2. Any profits generated by the token’s market making system are redistributed back to token holders.
3. Teams that launch their token on Baseline demonstrate a strong commitment to sustained value creation. By forgoing traditional tokenomics like time-based vesting, they signal their dedication to long-term success.
