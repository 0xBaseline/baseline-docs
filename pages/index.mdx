## Introduction

Baseline is a decentralized protocol that leverages Uniswap V3 technology to manage the liquidity and pricing of ERC20 tokens. By employing smart contracts to execute a basic market making strategy, Baseline eliminates the need for traditional market makers. Since the token controls its own market making operations, it can maintain a unique liquidity structure that helps facilitate positive price development.

The fundamental difference between Baseline and traditional market making strategies is that Baseline’s key objective is to maximize value for its token holders. At a very high level, this is accomplished via two mechanisms:

1. On the buy-side, Baseline market making provides deep concentrated liquidity, which creates a rising floor price [BLV] for the token. 
2. On the sell-side, Baseline market making provides continuous liquidity, allowing for constant price discovery.

In Baseline, any market making profits that accrue over time are redistributed back to token holders. Imagine a market maker whose sole objective is to distribute tokens in a fair and transparent manner, while supporting positive price development through a rising buy wall.

This kind of liquidity management is only possible because the entire token supply is minted and managed within Baseline’s programmatic market making system.
