## What is Baseline?

Baseline is a new standard for launching and trading tokens — one where liquidity works for the token, not against it.

Most tokens today launch into markets that drain value: inefficient liquidity, predatory market makers, and misaligned 
incentives. Baseline flips that model by building tokens that generate and retain value.

By replacing extractive practices with an autonomous liquidity engine, Baseline protects long-term value, rewards 
participation, and aligns creators, traders, and holders. With a guaranteed price floor (BLV), native DeFi mechanics 
like borrowing and looping, and liquidity that scales with demand, Baseline builds tokens designed to grow.


### Better Tokens Built for Growth
**Baseline is more than a set of DeFi features — it's token infrastructure engineered for sustainable, compounding growth.**

By combining a guaranteed price floor (BLV) with capital-efficient borrowing and non-liquidatable leverage, Baseline 
automatically scales liquidity to support higher prices, deeper markets, and fairer participation.

This enables **higher volumes and better price action throughout a token’s entire lifetime.**


### Aligned Incentives by Design
Everyone in the ecosystem interacts with the same mechanics — and benefits from doing so:
- **Traders** amplify exposure and enjoy deep liquidity and visible price floors.
- **Holders** benefit as floor price rises through trading activity.
- **Creators** earn sustainable fees from token volume.
There are no backdoors, no insider privileges, and no zero-sum dynamics. Everyone’s incentives point in the same 
direction: long-term strength.


### Efficient Capital Formation
Everything in Baseline flows from one core idea: **Getting more value out of every dollar.**  
This unlocks value to both sides of the market:
- **For projects:** more volume, stronger price charts, greater ecosystem wealth, less overhead, and lower counterparty risk.
- **For traders:** more upside, less risk, and a system that doesn’t rely on insiders to move.

Our vision is to make launching and participating in token markets feel fair, fun, and fundamentally better — 
all by making liquidity truly autonomous. 


### Intelligent Market Making
Baseline removes the need for human market makers. Instead, the system itself handles price discovery and liquidity 
adjustment through deterministic, on-chain logic.

This means:
- No custom deals.
- No private spreads.
- No silent value extraction.

Baseline Market Maker is the liquidity engine working for holders, and manipulated by none.


### Key Takeaway
To Baseline, sustainable tokenomics isn’t about locking tokens or writing clever emissions schedules. It’s about 
building a system where **value recirculates, incentives align, and everyone plays by the same rules** — Autonomously.
