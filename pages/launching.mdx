##Launching a Baseline Token

### Introduction 

Launching a Baseline token involves a structured process consisting of three key areas: Presale, Liquidity Configuration, and Tokenomics.

### Presale

Each Baseline token will undergo a fixed-price auction in order to source the initial capital needed to set up the liquidity pool. The presale will have a capital limit and allowlist to ensure fair participation and distribution of tokens.

### Liquidity Configuration

Each Baseline token will have a unique liquidity configuration that its project team will define. This configuration will affect how the token is traded and managed by its own market making system.

#### Liquidity Allocation

The raised funds from the presale will be allocated between the Floor, Anchor, and Afterburner. The split in allocation will decide the BLV price, market premium, and amount of leveraged buyback respectively.

#### Liquidity Depth

The liquidity depth can be configured in the market making system to control the price impact from buy and sell orders. High liquidity depth allows the market to absorb large transactions without causing significant price changes, whereas low liquidity depth allows for greater price movements and higher volatility.

### Tokenomics

Baseline tokenomics offer a distinct approach compared to traditional models. At the time of launch, the entire token supply is either seeded into the liquidity pool or distributed to presale participants and investors. This model eliminates the need for time-based vesting schedules that are common in traditional tokenomics.

We recognize that teams may have already received funding from investors, and that these investors should receive greater token upside compared to the average presale participant. To reward these investors, Baseline introduces a looped position [link] mechanism that can be initialized at launch. This approach offers investors leveraged exposure to the token. Any increase in the bToken's value relative to the reserve asset is magnified, providing potential for higher returns.

#### Looped Positions

Unlike traditional vesting, where investors frequently dump their tokens at a scheduled point in time, the looped position strategy aligns investor incentives with the token’s growth. Investors can exit their positions at any time, but will lose the benefits of the leveraged upside if they choose to take profit early on.

Allowing investors to exit their positions immediately after launch might seem risky. However, the BLV’s supporting liquidity structure helps mitigate potential adverse price impacts from early selling. Unlike other tokens, which might experience severe price drops due to early investor exits, the BLV provides a stabilizing effect that allows the token to consistently perform. 

#### Inflation Rate

The inflation rate is the amount of tokens that are minted and sent to the project team’s multisig whenever a `bump()` operation is executed. This feature enables the team to benefit financially when the token is performing well. The inflation rate is a configurable variable that teams can define at the time of deployment. 

Here’s an example of how this works:

1. Suppose the floating supply of a bToken is 1,000 tokens.
2. When a `bump()` operation is carried out to increase the BLV, the inflation rate comes into play.
3. For example, if the inflation rate is set at 1%, the system will mint and introduce an additional 10 bTokens into the floating supply, making the total supply 1,010 tokens.
4. These 10 bTokens are sent to the team’s multisig.
