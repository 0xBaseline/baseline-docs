# Migration FAQ

_____

**Is YES live on Base?**

- **No. We will announce when YES is deployed.** 

_____

**When will the migration take place?**

- Official dates have not yet been announced, migration will coincide with the V3 launch. 
Keep an eye out for an official launch announcement on Discord.

_____

**What tokens are affected?**

- The YES token will be migrated. Other Baseline tokens will have the opportunity 
to migrate should they decide to do so in the future.

_____

**What do I need to do?**

- Spot - nothing, your tokens will be automatically migrated for you
- Credit - nothing, your credit position will be automatically migrated for you
- Loop - nothing, your looped position will be automatically migrated for you
- LP - please close your LP position prior to the transfer lock leading up to migration

_____

**How will the migration happen?**

- At the start of migration YES tokens will be transfer-locked on Blast. 
Holders will receive an airdrop of YES tokens on base that will be transfer-locked. 
The team will then work to move the ETH liquidity from Blast to Base. Typically this transfer 
would take up to a week, but the team is working with a market maker who will help expedite the process. 
We anticipate that it will take a few hours. During this time no trading or LP activity will be able 
to take place. Once the liquidity is migrated, the YES tokens on base will be unlocked and normal 
trading activity can resume.

_____

**Is there a migration deadline?**

- No there is no deadline, because the token will be automatically migrated for you and there 
is no action needed on your part.

_____

**How will I know that migration was successful?**

- You will see the tokens in your wallet on Base and there will be an announcement on twitter 
and in Discord

_____

**Will migration impact the token?**

- YES will be recreated on Base with the same parameters it had on Blast.

_____

**Is there a cost for migration?**

- There are no user costs for migration. Holders may find it helpful to have Base ETH for 
future token interactions.

_____

**What happens if I don't close my LP in time?**

- We recommend everyone closing their LP prior to migration. If you have not closed your LP prior 
to the Blast transfer-lock of tokens, you will simply be airdropped the equivalent spot $YES tokens on 
Base. Your ETH side of the position will be unable to be traded since the Uniswap transactions will 
fail once the transfer-lock occurs, preventing you from closing the LP. To remedy this, we will have 
a special contract available for LP’s to approve that will unlock the ETH side, and move it from Uniswap 
into your wallet.

_____

**What happens if I have YES deposited in other protocols?**

- We recommend closing your position before the migration. If that’s not possible, and you’d like to 
discuss options, please reach out to us in Discord.
