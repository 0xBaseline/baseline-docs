any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising 
out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use of the Website, including, but not limited to, any use of the 
Website content, services and products other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use or your use of any information 
obtained from the Website.

## Governing Law and Jurisdiction
All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto 
(in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal 
laws of the Cayman Islands without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the Cayman Islands 
or any other jurisdiction).

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with the Website and these Terms of Use, including any question regarding its existence, 
validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the London Court of International 
Arbitration (“LCIA”), which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The number of arbitrators shall be one. 
The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom. The language to be used in the arbitration shall be English. 
You and Baseline Markets agree to submit all Disputes between you and Baseline Markets to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute” 
means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Baseline Markets that relates to the Website and these Terms of Use.

If a Dispute must be arbitrated, you or Baseline Markets must start arbitration of the Dispute within one (1) year from when the 
Dispute first arose. If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than one (1) year after the Dispute first 
arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period. Baseline Markets encourages you to tell us about a Dispute as soon as 
possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice will bar all claims.

In any Dispute, the arbitrator will award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the 
prevailing party in connection with those aspects of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and 
legal fees awards will be offset.

Any breach by you of these Terms of Use could cause Baseline Markets irreparable harm for which it has no adequate remedies at law. 
Accordingly, Baseline Markets is entitled to seek specific performance or injunctive relief for any such breach. Nothing in this 
section will preclude Baseline Markets from seeking specific performance or injunctive relief from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

## Waiver and Severability
No waiver by Baseline Markets of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing 
waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Baseline Markets to assert a right 
or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or 
unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions 
of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

## Entire Agreement
The Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and other terms and conditions applicable at the time you access the Website constitute 
the sole and entire agreement between you and Baseline Markets with respect to the Website and supersede all prior and 
contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Website.
