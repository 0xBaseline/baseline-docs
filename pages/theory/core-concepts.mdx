# ðŸ“– Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts that make Baseline work. Understanding these principles will help you make better decisions as a creator, trader, or developer.

## What You'll Learn

### Autonomous Liquidity Engine (ALE)
The core innovation that provides continuous liquidity without external market makers.

### BLV (Baseline Liquidity Vault)
The smart contract system that manages liquidity and maintains price floors.

### Liquidity Skew
How the protocol shapes bid/ask spreads to encourage desired trading behavior.

### Inventory Ratios & Reflexivity
The mathematical relationships that create self-reinforcing price discovery.

### The Role of YES
How the governance token incentivizes participation and aligns interests.

## Why These Concepts Matter

Understanding these core concepts will help you:

- **As a Creator**: Design better token parameters and incentives
- **As a Trader**: Make more informed trading decisions
- **As a Developer**: Build on top of Baseline effectively

## Learning Path

Start with the Autonomous Liquidity Engine, then progress through each concept. The advanced mechanics section builds on these fundamentals.

## Key Insights

- Baseline uses protocol-owned liquidity instead of relying on external market makers
- Price discovery happens through coordinated trading rather than pure speculation
- The system is designed to be resistant to manipulation and MEV extraction
- All mechanics are transparent and verifiable on-chain
