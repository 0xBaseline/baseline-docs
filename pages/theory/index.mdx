# Baseline Value (BLV)

Every Baseline token has a **floor price** — a minimum price that is always backed by on-chain liquidity. 
This floor is not arbitrary. It’s determined by a core mechanic called **Baseline Value**, or **BLV**. 

The BLV acts as the **guaranteed exit price**, regardless of market conditions. The BLV is the center of Baseline’s 
mechanics, enabling efficient liquidity provisioning and 0% interest, unliquidatable lending.

## Why It Matters
BLV transforms how token value is created and preserved. Rather than relying on volatile market 
forces or centralized liquidity providers, Baseline gives every token an autonomous and transparent system 
for building value over time — from the bottom up.

- **Downside Protection:** BLV guarantees a sell price, reducing the risk of catastrophic losses and making tokens safer to hold.
- **Market Integrity:** Because BLV is on-chain and cannot be manipulated or removed, it eliminates common risks like 
liquidity rug-pulls.
- **Aligned Incentives:** As more users interact with the token — through trading, staking, or looping — the BLV 
increases, reinforcing a shared incentive to grow the token’s value.
- **Unlocking DeFi Utility:** BLV is not just a floor — it’s collateral. Token holders can borrow against their BLV 
at 0% interest, creating liquidity without selling or risking liquidation. 



## How It Works
Each Baseline token (bToken) starts off with a defined BLV value when it is created. This acts as the minimum 
price that the Baseline market maker (BMM) is willing to buy every circulating token at. Every subsequent incoming 
buy will be at this BLV or above, and same with every sell. 

When someone buys a Baseline token, part of their trade goes into a locked reserve that increases the token’s BLV. 
Over time, as more people buy and trade, BLV grows — lifting the token’s **floor price**.

BLV ensures that there is always buy-side liquidity available. Anyone can sell their tokens into the BLV at any time, 
even if there are no active buyers on the other side. This mechanism offers a level of downside protection that most 
tokens lack.
