# Loans: Access Capital Without Selling 

Holders of Baseline tokens can **borrow against their BLV** â€” the guaranteed floor value â€” with 0% interest. 
This means they can access liquidity without selling their tokens, without risking liquidation, and without 
giving up future upside.

Borrowing is non-custodial and on-demand. The loan amount is determined by how much floor value the user 
has (based on their token holdings and the BLV). Repayment is optional.

## Example
- Jim has 1 ETH and decides to get exposure to YES. 
- At current prices (0.001357 per token), Jim can buy 737 YES.
- The BLV is 0.001231 per token. Jim can instantly borrow 737 x 0.001231 = 0.9 eth while maintaining price 
exposure to 737 YES tokens. 
- Since Jim spent 1 eth and borrowed 0.9 ETH, they technically only risked 0.1 ETH 
of capital to get price exposure to 737 YES tokens.

**Key Takeaway:** Baseline turns token liquidity into a productive asset.
- **Borrowing** allows users to unlock liquidity without selling, preserving their position and exposure.
- **Leveraging** lets users compound their exposure by using borrowed liquidity to buy more â€” increasing demand and floor value.

Together, these mechanics create a positive-sum system where tokens grow in utility and value, and users have 
more ways to participate without relying on external DeFi tools.
