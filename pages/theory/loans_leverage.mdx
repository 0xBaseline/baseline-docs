## Loans: Access Capital Without Selling 

Holders of Baseline tokens can **borrow against their BLV** — the guaranteed floor value — with 0% interest. 
This means they can access liquidity without selling their tokens, without risking liquidation, and without 
giving up future upside.

Borrowing is non-custodial and on-demand. The loan amount is determined by how much floor value the user 
has (based on their token holdings and the BLV). Repayment is optional.

**Example:**
Jim has 1 ETH and decides to get exposure to YES. At current prices (0.001357 per token), Jim can buy 737 YES.
The BLV is 0.001231 per token. Jim can instantly borrow 737 x 0.001231 = 0.9 eth while maintaining price 
exposure to 737 YES tokens. Since Jim spent 1 eth and borrowed 0.9 ETH, they technically only risked 0.1 ETH 
of capital to get price exposure to 737 YES tokens.

## Leverage without Liquidation Risk

Users can choose to “**loop**” — borrowing again and using that loan to buy more of the same token. 
This increases their holdings, creating a form of **self-reinforcing leverage**.

Each loop adds more volume, which grows the BLV further. This dynamic creates a flywheel effect:
- More loops → more buy volume → higher BLV → greater borrowing power.

Unlike traditional leveraged products, loops in Baseline do not carry forced liquidation risk. Users are 
only limited by system parameters and the available floor liquidity.

**Example:** 
Jim has 1 ETH and decides to get exposure to YES. At current prices (0.001357 per token), 
Jim can buy 737 YES.
What if Jim decided to loop? Using the Loop UI, 1 ETH translates to 6,780 YES. Notice that instead of 737 YES, 
the user now holds 9.2x more YES than if they simply bought.

**Key Takeaway:** Baseline turns token liquidity into a productive asset.
- **Borrowing** allows users to unlock liquidity without selling, preserving their position and exposure.
- **Looping** lets users compound their exposure by using borrowed liquidity to buy more — increasing demand and floor value.

Together, these mechanics create a positive-sum system where tokens grow in utility and value, and users have 
more ways to participate without relying on external DeFi tools.
