# Staking: Earn Trading Fees

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Staking is **not live yet**.
</Callout>

Baseline allows you to stake your bTokens to earn a share of the protocol's trading fees. 
This creates a way for holders to generate yield simply by staking their tokens.

## Why Stake?
- Earn a share of trading fees (in reserves)
- Capitalize on volatility without taking on impermanent loss

## How it works
Every time someone buys or sells a bToken through the Baseline market, a small trading fee is collected. 
This fee is automatically routed back to the protocol's reserve system and distributed to stakers over time.
