# Staking: Earn Fees from Protocol Activity

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Staking as a feature is still in active development.
</Callout>

Baseline allows you to stake your bTokens to earn a share of the protocol's trading fees. 
This creates a way for holders to generate yield simply by staking their tokens.

# How it works
Every time someone buys or sells a bToken through the Baseline market, 
a small trading fee is collected. This fee is automatically routed back to the protocol's reserve 
system and distributed to stakers over time.

- **Who pays the fee?** Traders interacting with the Baseline Market Maker pay a small spread (as part of pool fee)
- **What happens to the fee?** Fees are captured by the protocol and redirected to staking pools for the corresponding bToken.

## Why Stake?
- Earn a share of trading fees (in reserves)
- Capitalize on volatility without taking on impermanent loss
