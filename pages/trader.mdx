## Tokenomics are Broken


Today, project teams issue tokens to themselves and sell tokens to private investors (at low cost basis) in order to 
incentivize team members and raise funds, respectively. As these tokens unlock, investors rush to sell their tokens ahead 
of each other, creating a race to the bottom. This significant imbalance between supply and demand results in market 
instability and reduced investor confidence.


## A Better System


Baseline was created in direct response to the exploitative practices that market participants are forced to endure. 
Baseline aims to establish markets where transparency and fairness are hard requirements, and built-in at the technological 
level. The goal is to change the underlying mechanisms and align market participants towards shared, long-term value creation.

### Tokenomics
In Baseline, all tokens are minted and distributed to investors at time of launch without any vesting schedules, 
thereby removing any supply overhang. Baseline mitigates the risks associated with early investor sell-offs by ensuring 
that there is sufficient liquidity to maintain a guaranteed [floor price](/concepts). This provides a stable exit point 
for all token holders, and builds confidence in investors by having transparent downside risk.
