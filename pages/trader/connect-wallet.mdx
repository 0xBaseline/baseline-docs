# Connect Wallet & Start Trading

Learn how to connect your wallet and make your first trade on the Baseline Terminal.

## What to Expect When Trading bTokens

Baseline tokens (bTokens) trade just like any other token — but the mechanics under the hood work differently.

When you buy a bToken, you're not trading against another user. You're trading against the protocol's automated 
liquidity engine. That engine adjusts price based on volume and flow, while storing a portion of liquidity at 
the **BLV (Baseline Value)** — the guaranteed minimum price floor.

## What Makes bToken Trading Different?

- **Visible floor price** – Every bToken has a public, on-chain minimum price. You can always exit at 
this floor, even if no one else is buying.
- **Price impact depends on volume** – Buying pushes price up, selling pushes it down. But the floor ensures 
the price doesn't collapse.
- **Fees grow the system** – The trading fee of each trade goes toward the stakers.

## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Navigate to [app.baseline.markets](https://app.baseline.markets)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right
3. Choose your preferred wallet:
   - MetaMask
   - WalletConnect
   - Rabby
   - Other supported wallets
4. Approve the connection

## Step 2: Browse Available Tokens

You can browse live tokens and presales directly at app.baseline.markets

Each token page shows:
- Current price
- Floor price (BLV)
- Volume
- Other trading data

## Step 3: Make Your First Trade

1. Select a token you want to trade
2. Choose "Buy" or "Sell"
3. Enter the amount you want to trade
4. Review the transaction details
5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet

## What You'll Need

To trade a bToken, all you need is:
- A supported wallet (e.g. Rabby)
- Native gas token (e.g. ETH) for transactions
- USDC or ETH to buy the bToken, depending on the market

## Key Trading Features

### Continuous Liquidity
Unlike traditional DEXs, bTokens always have liquidity available through the BLV.

### Price Floor Protection
Every bToken has a built-in price floor, reducing downside risk.

### Transparent Pricing
All prices and fees are visible on-chain, with no hidden costs.
