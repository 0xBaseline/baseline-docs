# Trade bTokens
Baseline tokens include more than just a market price — they have a built-in floor (BLV), 
dynamic liquidity structure, and trading volume that impacts rewards and market behavior. 
Knowing how to read these metrics helps you make better investment decisions.

## What makes bTokens different?
- **Visible floor price** – Every bToken has a public, on-chain minimum price. You can always exit at (or above) 
this price, even if no one else is buying.
- **Access to capital** - You can borrow your bToken's BLV value at 0% interest, accessing capital without having to sell your position.
- **Leverage** - You can use borrowed funds to buy more bTokens, amplifying your gains.
- **Fees grow the system** – The trading fee of each trade goes toward the stakers.

## Key Metrics to Watch
- **Market Price** – The current trading price based on protocol liquidity.
- **BLV (Baseline Value)** – The guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves.
- **Premium** – The % difference between market price and BLV.
- **Volume** – Drives staking rewards and BLV growth. More volume = more system value.
