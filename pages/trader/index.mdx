# Trading bTokens
Baseline tokens include more than just a market price — they have a built-in floor (BLV), 
dynamic liquidity structure, and trading volume that impacts rewards and market behavior.

Knowing how to read these metrics helps you make better decisions.

Learn how to connect your wallet and make your first trade on the Baseline Terminal.

## What Makes bToken Trading Different?
- **Visible floor price** – Every bToken has a public, on-chain minimum price. You can always exit at 
this floor, even if no one else is buying.
- **Price impact depends on volume** – Buying pushes price up, selling pushes it down. But the floor ensures 
the price doesn't collapse.
- **Fees grow the system** – The trading fee of each trade goes toward the stakers.



## Key Metrics to Watch
- Market Price – The current trading price based on protocol liquidity.
- BLV (Baseline Value) – The guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves.
- Premium – The % difference between market price and BLV. A high premium signals demand and may trigger BLV bumps.
- Volume – Drives staking rewards and BLV growth. More volume = more system value.
