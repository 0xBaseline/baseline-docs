# Leveraging bTokens

Learn how to amplify your positions using Baseline's looping mechanism.

## Leveraging with Loops

### Amplify Exposure by Re-Buying with Borrowed Funds

Looping lets you borrow against your bToken, then use that borrowed liquidity to buy more of the same 
token — increasing your exposure and growing your floor position.

It's a way to go leveraged long without liquidation risk.

### How It Works
- Borrow against your bToken's BLV.
- Use the borrowed funds to buy more bTokens.
- Repeat to compound your position.

Each loop adds buy pressure and increases BLV, benefiting both you and the broader holder base.

### Key Differences from Borrowing
- Borrowing gives you liquidity without selling.
- Looping uses that liquidity to re-enter the market — amplifying gains (and risks).

There's no liquidation, but the token price still matters: looping increases exposure, so you're still 
affected by market movement.

## Understanding Looping Mechanics

### The Loop Process

1. **Initial Position**: You hold bTokens with a certain BLV value
2. **Borrow**: Use your bTokens as collateral to borrow against their BLV
3. **Reinvest**: Use borrowed funds to buy more of the same bToken
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process to compound your position

### Benefits of Looping

- **Amplified Gains**: Increase your exposure to token price movements
- **No Liquidation Risk**: Unlike traditional leverage, there's no forced selling
- **BLV Growth**: Each loop contributes to the token's price floor
- **Community Benefit**: Looping creates positive price pressure for all holders

### Risks to Consider

- **Increased Exposure**: Larger positions mean bigger gains and losses
- **Gas Costs**: Each loop requires multiple transactions
- **Market Timing**: Poor timing can amplify losses
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of the mechanics

## Getting Started with Looping

### Prerequisites

- Hold bTokens with staking enabled
- Understand the risks involved
- Have ETH for gas fees

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Stake Your Tokens**: First, stake your bTokens to earn rewards
2. **Check Borrowing Capacity**: Verify how much you can borrow against your stake
3. **Execute Loop**: Borrow funds and immediately buy more tokens
4. **Monitor Position**: Track your amplified position and manage risk

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small loops to understand the mechanics
2. **Monitor Closely**: Keep track of your position size and market conditions
3. **Have Exit Strategy**: Plan how you'll unwind positions if needed
4. **Consider Gas Costs**: Factor in transaction fees when calculating returns

## Advanced Looping Strategies

### Compound Looping
- Reinvest borrowed funds multiple times
- Maximize exposure while managing risk
- Requires careful position sizing

### Partial Looping
- Loop only a portion of your position
- Maintain some unleveraged exposure
- Balance risk and reward

### Dynamic Looping
- Adjust loop size based on market conditions
- Increase loops during bullish periods
- Reduce exposure during uncertainty

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- Never loop more than you can afford to lose
- Consider the maximum downside scenario
- Maintain adequate reserves for gas fees

### Market Monitoring
- Watch for significant price movements
- Be prepared to adjust positions quickly
- Understand the relationship between price and BLV

### Exit Strategies
- Plan how to unwind positions
- Consider partial exits to lock in gains
- Have emergency procedures for market stress
