# Monitor Your Positions

Learn how to track and manage your bToken positions effectively.

## Monitoring Token Performance

### Understand What Drives Price, Floor, and Volume

Baseline tokens include more than just a market price — they have a built-in floor (BLV), 
dynamic liquidity structure, and trading volume that impacts rewards and market behavior.

Knowing how to read these metrics helps you make better decisions.

### Key Metrics to Watch

- **Market Price** – The current trading price based on protocol liquidity.
- **BLV (Baseline Value)** – The guaranteed price floor, backed by reserves.
- **Premium** – The % difference between market price and BLV. A high premium signals demand and may trigger BLV bumps.
- **Volume** – Drives rewards and BLV growth. More volume = more system value.
- **Utilization** – How much buffer liquidity the protocol is using. Higher utilization = more aggressive market-making.

You can view all live token metrics on [baseline.markets](https://baseline.markets), including real-time floor prices and protocol actions.

## Setting Up Monitoring

### Dashboard Access

### Key Alerts to Set
- **Price Movements**: Large changes in token price
- **BLV Updates**: When floor prices are adjusted
- **Reward Accumulation**: Staking rewards ready to claim
- **Borrowing Limits**: Approaching maximum borrowing capacity

## Understanding the Metrics

### Price vs. BLV Relationship
- **Premium**: When market price > BLV
- **Discount**: When market price < BLV (rare due to floor protection)
- **Convergence**: Price moving toward BLV

### Volume Impact
- **High Volume**: Usually indicates strong demand and potential BLV increases
- **Low Volume**: May suggest reduced interest or consolidation
- **Volume Patterns**: Look for trends over time

### Utilization Analysis
- **High Utilization**: Protocol is actively managing liquidity
- **Low Utilization**: More passive market making
- **Spikes**: May indicate significant market events
