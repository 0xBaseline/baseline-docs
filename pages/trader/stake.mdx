## Staking and Earning Rewards

### Put Your Tokens to Work

Baseline introduces protocol-native staking that lets bToken holders earn rewards directly 
from trading activity — no separate apps or wrappers required.

When you stake a bToken, you’re not providing liquidity or taking price exposure — you’re 
simply temporarily locking your tokens to earn a share of trading fees.


### How It Works
- Protocol fees from trading and borrowing are collected into a reward pool.
- Stakers earn a proportional share of these fees based on how much they’ve staked.
- Rewards accumulate over time and can be claimed or restaked at any time.


### Key Benefits
- No impermanent loss – You’re not LPing, so there’s no exposure to losses resulting from your 
token ratios being auto-rebalanced. 
- Passive yield – Earn from protocol activity without active management.
- Aligned with volume – The more a token is traded, the more rewards are generated.


### Coming Soon
Staking is being rolled out gradually across bTokens. You can check whether a token supports 
staking by visiting its page on [app.baseline.markets.](https://app.baseline.markets)

## Staking and Earning Rewards

### Put Your Tokens to Work

Baseline introduces protocol-native staking that lets bToken holders earn rewards directly 
from trading activity — no separate apps or wrappers required.

When you stake a bToken, you're not providing liquidity or taking price exposure — you're 
simply temporarily locking your tokens to earn a share of trading fees.

### How It Works
- Protocol fees from trading and borrowing are collected into a reward pool.
- Stakers earn a proportional share of these fees based on how much they've staked.
- Rewards accumulate over time and can be claimed or restaked at any time.

### Key Benefits
- **No impermanent loss** – You're not LPing, so there's no exposure to losses resulting from your 
token ratios being auto-rebalanced. 
- **Passive yield** – Earn from protocol activity without active management.
- **Aligned with volume** – The more a token is traded, the more rewards are generated.

## Borrowing Against Your Positions

### Leverage Your Holdings

You can also borrow against your staked positions to:

- Access liquidity without selling your tokens
- Amplify your exposure through leverage
- Create more complex trading strategies

### How Borrowing Works
1. Stake your bTokens to earn rewards
2. Use your staked position as collateral
3. Borrow against the value of your stake
4. Use borrowed funds for additional trading or other purposes

## Getting Started with Staking

### Step 1: Choose a Token
Visit [app.baseline.markets](https://app.baseline.markets) and select a token that supports staking.

### Step 2: Stake Your Tokens
1. Navigate to the staking section
2. Enter the amount you want to stake
3. Confirm the transaction
4. Start earning rewards immediately

### Step 3: Monitor and Claim
- Track your accumulated rewards
- Claim rewards anytime
- Restake rewards to compound your earnings

## Risk Considerations

### Staking Risks
- **Smart contract risk**: Always verify contracts before staking
- **Token price risk**: While staked, you're still exposed to token price movements
- **Liquidity risk**: Some staking positions may have lock periods

### Borrowing Risks
- **Liquidation risk**: If collateral value falls, positions may be liquidated
- **Interest costs**: Borrowing incurs interest that reduces net returns
- **Market volatility**: Rapid price movements can affect collateral ratios

## Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Begin with small amounts to understand the mechanics
2. **Diversify**: Don't stake all your tokens in one place
3. **Monitor regularly**: Check your positions and rewards frequently
4. **Understand fees**: Be aware of staking and borrowing fees
