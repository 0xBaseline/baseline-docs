# Stake bTokens
Baseline introduces protocol-native staking that lets bToken holders earn rewards directly 
from trading activity — no separate apps or wrappers required.

## How It Works
- Protocol fees from trading are streamed to a staking contract
- Stakers earn a proportional share of these fees based on how much they've staked.
- Rewards accumulate over time and can be claimed or restaked at any time.
- Users who borrow and/or leverage are eligible for staking rewards.
