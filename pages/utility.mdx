## Non-Liquidatable Leverage

Beyond its impact on market sentiment, the BLV enables a novel DeFi mechanic: non-liquidatable, oracleless 
lending. This innovative approach significantly enhances the utility and efficiency of bTokens.

Baseline's unique BLV guarantee allows the protocol to offer leverage on bTokens by preemptively lending 
their underlying BLV directly from the liquidity pool. Since the protocol can always buy back each bToken 
at the BLV price, it can never accumulate bad debt from these loans. Any unpaid loans are effectively treated 
as buybacks at the lowest possible price, allowing users to repay loans on their own terms without worrying 
about market activity. 

The absence of liquidation risk also eliminates the need for oracles, drastically simplifying the protocol's
lending implementation. This enables Baseline to offer various forms of non-liquiditable leverage for bToken 
holders, drastically improving their capital efficiency and liquidity.

### Infinite liquidity

Unlike other most lending protocols, users borrow directly from the protocol-owned reserves rather than from 
other users. This approach eliminates the risk of third-party lenders removing liquidity during periods of market 
stress. Instead, liquidity comes directly from its protocol-owned liquidity positions, starting with the Floor 
position. Whenever a new loan is opened, Baseline pulls the corresponding liquidity directly from the liquidity 
pool. This allows Baseline to offer infinite liquidity, since there is always more liquidity than the amount of 
borrowable BLV across the total circulating supply.

    If you look at the transaction for a loan, you might see a lot of tokens moving around. This is because the
    protocol is withdrawing the liquidity directly from the pool.

### Loan-to-Value: LTV

Loan-to-Value, or LTV, is a crucial concept in lending. It describes the amount of capital you can borrow for 
the amount of capital collateralized: the higher the LTV, the more efficient the loan. Most lending protocols 
today rely on a third-party services or governance control to determine safe LTVs for accepted collateral, but 
Baseline's lending implementation automatically offers the highest possible LTV while still being safe.

In the Baseline system, a bToken's LTV is purely market-driven: as a bToken's price approaches its BLV, users 
can borrow more relative to their collateral's cost. This introduces a unique dynamic to the bToken market 
structure, where buyers gain increased access to capital as a bToken's price decreases: the increase in leverage, 
coupled with an improved risk-return profile, also contributes to sustaining a healthy market premium for a bTokens.

When loans are taken in Baseline, users don't choose the amount to borrow against their collateral; 
the protocol automatically borrows the maximum allowable amount (the full BLV).
