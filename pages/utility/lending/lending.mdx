## Baseline Lending

Baseline offers a unique lending facility where users can deposit their bTokens as collateral and withdraw the reserve asset for a small loan fee. Since each bToken is backed by its [BLV](/concepts/blv), the lending facility is able to issue loans equal to the intrinsic value (BLV) of the deposited collateral without any liquidation risk. The lending facility is able to withdraw reserves from the [Floor](market_making/floor#floor) without impacting the backing of bTokens since any bTokens deposited as collateral are effectively removed from the floating supply.

### Key Concepts

Baseline Lending stands out from traditional lending markets in several key ways:

- **Peer-to-Protocol** - Users borrow directly from the protocol-owned reserves rather than from other users. This approach eliminates the risk of third-party lenders removing liquidity during periods of market stress.
- **Fixed duration** - Loans are granted for a set term, and once expired, the collateral is burned.
- **No interest rates** - Loans are not charged ongoing interest, but rather a one-time origination fee based on the borrowed value and loan term duration (fee is 0.027% per day). Loans can be extended for the same fee.
- **Isolated risk architecture** - Unlike other lending markets that socialize borrower risk through a shared pool architecture, Baseline keeps each loan separate. A user can only have one loan at a time, but may add or decrease this loan position.
- **No liquidations** - Since every token is backed by reserves at the floor price value, the protocol doesn't need to manage a liquidation engine. This means the protocol does not need to seize a borrower’s assets and perform a sell off. In the event of a loan default (due to expiry), the protocol simply burns the collateral.
- **No oracles** - Since there are no liquidations, the lending facility doesn't require any oracles to function, making it simpler and secure from external price manipulation risks.

### Interactions
- **Opening a loan:** To initiate a loan, users deposit bTokens into the lending facility and receive reserve assets in return, minus the borrow fee. Note that users cannot open a new loan if they already have an existing one.
For example, if a bToken trades at $1.20 USDC and has a BLV of $1.00, depositing 1 bToken for 100 days allows the user to withdraw $0.973 USDC after deducting the lending fee ($1.00 USDC * 0.027% * 100)
- **Repaying a loan:** Users can repay their loan at any time prior to expiration by depositing reserves into the lending facility, and receiving a proportional amount of their collateral back. Partial repayments are also permitted.
- **Extending a loan:** Loans can be extended, if they have not expired, by interacting with the lending facility.
- **Adding to a loan:** Users can deposit additional bTokens as collateral and increase their existing loan position.
- **Defaulting on Loans:** The protocol automatically defaults all expired loans at the end of each day by burning the collateral. Upon default, even though the protocol's reserves have decreased, the burned collateral value exceeds the borrowed value. This effectively bolsters the liquidity structure of the pool and allows the system to progress towards the next `bump()`.

### Lending Fees
The fees that the lending facility earns are sent to the [Afterburner](/concepts/afterburner) module to conduct leveraged token buybacks and token burning. Token burns increase the system’s surplus capacity and make progress towards initiating the next [`bump()`](/concepts/market_making#rebalancing-liquidity) operation.
