## Fixed Term Liquidity Loans

Tokens today present their holders with a dilemma: realizing any gains typically requires selling, 
sacrificing exposure to future upside in exchange for liquidity. While some tokens may be listed as 
collateral on lending platforms, the process is restrictive, unreliable, and highly dependent on 
external liquidity for borrowing capacity.

Coupled with the naturally attention-driven markets and inefficient liquidity structures in crypto today, 
the opportunity cost problem of holding tokens can result in extreme volatility as traders rotate in and 
out of different assets. Baseline directly addresses this issue by offering simple fixed-term, fixed-interest
loans against bToken collateral, giving users a new way to realize the value of their assets without
sacrificing upside exposure by borrowing. 
 
In Baseline, bTokens can be deposited to withdraw their underlying BLV liquidity for an upfront fee. 
All collected fees are directed to the Afterburner, ensuring that any generated value from borrowing 
activity accrues directly to the bToken holders.


### Loan Fees & Terms

Baseline's loan fees are paid upfront and pro-rated to a fixed yearly interest rate based on the duration of 
the loan. Users can configure the duration of the loan in increments of days, providing users full flexibility 
over loan terms and allowing them to pay only for what they need. Users are limited to one active loan per bToken, 
but can add collateral to existing positions to increase their borrow position.

    In $YES, the fixed-term fee is 9.9% per year, so a 30-day loan would be charged 9.9%*(30/365) = ~.84% of 
    the loan amount.

Loans can be repaid early or extended, though early repayments don't result in fee refunds. Thus, it's advisable 
to open shorter-duration loans and extend as needed rather than initially opting for longer terms. The expiry of 
the new loan will be the same as the existing loan, and any new extensions will apply to the entire aggregate loan.

While Baseline loans can't be liquidated due to market activity, expired loans are automatically defaulted. 
This mechanism is crucial for maintaining system efficiency, as Baseline's BLV accounting provisions liquidity 
for each circulating token: defaulting expired loans prevents "dead supply" accumulation from lost tokens or 
inaccessible wallets, allowing liquidity to accumulate to remaining bTokens more efficiently. 

<Callout>
    Because bTokens are burned upon expiration, loans that expire result in the borrowers losing the premium 
    value of their bToken collateral. As a result, it's important to manage loan terms carefully to avoid defaulting.

### Boosting

Baseline's unique lending model allowing users to borrow more liquidity without additional collateral when the 
BLV grows. This is possible because the userâ€™s deposited collateral has increased in value due to the BLV increase: 
since the lending facility calculates how much can be borrowed based on the BLV of the deposited collateral, 
the borrowing capacity will have increased. 

For example, if a user initially deposits 1000 bTokens with a $1.00 BLV, they can borrow $1000. If the BLV increases 
to $1.02, the borrowing capacity rises to $1020, offering an additional $20 of borrowable capital. Boosting is entirely
options, and any boosts incur the same fees and terms as any other loan in the Credit Facility.
