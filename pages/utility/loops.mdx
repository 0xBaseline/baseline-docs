## Leveraged bToken Exposure

While Baseline's lending facility allows users to leverage bTokens for exposure to other assets, 
'looping' provides a unique way to gain amplified exposure to the bToken itself. Looping involves 
repeatedly borrowing against bToken collateral to purchase more bTokens, creating a leveraged 
position that increases sensitivity to the bToken's price movements relative to the underlying 
reserve asset.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Like most forms of leverage, looping is an advanced strategy with significant risks. The strategy 
  effectively trades the bToken's floor guarantees for additional premium exposure, exposing users to
  full 100% drawdowns when bTokens trade at the floor.

  **Users should thoroughly understand the mechanics and potential outcomes of looping before opening a position.**

### Looping Mechanics

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
  Looping is not an infinite process. Each successive loop results in diminishing borrowing power 
  due to the difference between the bToken's market price and its BLV.
</Callout>

To illustrate how looping works, let's walk through a simplified example. For clarity, we'll assume 
no additional costs such as slippage, or swap fees.

**Initial Position**
- User owns 1,000 bTokens
- Market price: 1.20 USDC per bToken
- Baseline Value (BLV): 1.00 USDC per bToken

1. **First Loop**
   - User deposits 1,000 bTokens into the lending facility
   - Borrows 1,000 USDC (based on BLV)
   - Buys 833.33 bTokens at market price (1,000 USDC / 1.20 USDC per bToken)

2. **Second Loop**
   - Deposits the newly acquired 833.33 bTokens
   - Borrows another 833.33 USDC
   - Buys 694.44 bTokens (833.33 USDC / 1.20 USDC per bToken)

**Final Holdings**
- Total Collateral: 1,833.33 bTokens (from both deposit steps)
- Wallet Holdings: 694.44 bTokens
- Total Debt: 1,833.33 USDC

In total, the user now controls 2,527.77 bTokens with 1,833.33 USDC in debt. Note that despite the increased 
bToken holdings, the net value of the position remains the same (assuming no fees or price changes):

- Initial Value: 1,000 bTokens @ 1.20 USDC = 1,200 USDC
- Looped Value: (2,527.77 bTokens @ 1.20 USDC) - 1,833.33 USDC debt = 1,200 USDC

However, if the bToken price rises to 1.40 USDC, the looped position will have amplified gains:

- Initial Value: 1,000 bTokens @ 1.40 USDC = 1,400 USDC
- Looped Value: (2,527.77 bTokens @ 1.40 USDC) - 1,833.33 USDC debt = 2,027.77 USDC (over 4x the upside!)

Similarly, if bToken's price falls to 1.00 USDC, the looped position will have amplified losses:

- Initial Value: 1,000 bTokens @ 1.00 USDC = 1,000 USDC
- Looped Value: (2,527.77 bTokens @ 1.00 USDC) - 1,833.33 USDC debt = 694.44 USDC


### Origination Fee

Like [Baseline loans](/utility/loans), Baseline's 
looping facility charges an origination fee, and no interest rate. This fee is applied when opening a position 
or when adding to your loan based on the amount being added.


### Benefits and Risks of Looping

<Tabs items={['🚀 Benefits', '⚠️ Risks', '🎯 When to Loop', '🔄 How to Loop', '🚪 How to Exit']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Looping allows users to gain increased exposure to bToken price movements without additional capital investment. 
    When the bToken's price rises relative to the reserve asset, looped positions can see amplified returns.

    ![Looping Benefits](/assets/11.png)

    For example, if a bToken's price increases from $1.00 to $1.10 (a 10% gain), a looped position might see 
    a 20% or greater increase in value, depending on the leverage used.

    The primary risks of looping include:
    
    1. **Amplified Losses**: If the bToken's price falls relative to the reserve asset, losses are magnified.
    2. **Complexity**: The mechanics of looped positions can be challenging to understand and manage effectively.

    Users should carefully consider their risk tolerance and market outlook before engaging in looping.

    Looping tends to be most advantageous when:
    
    1. The bToken's price is close to its BLV, offering maximum capital efficiency and lower downside risk.
    2. You have a strong conviction in the bToken's price appreciation.
    3. You understand the risks involved and have a clear exit strategy.

    Remember, while looping near the BLV offers better capital efficiency, it should still be approached 
    with caution and a thorough understanding of the potential outcomes.

    Baseline has simplified the looping process with a built-in feature:

    1. Deposit reserve assets into the Loop Facility.
    2. The system automatically max loops the reserves for you.

    This streamlined process reduces complexity for users while still offering the benefits of a leveraged position.

    Exiting a looped position involves reversing the looping process:

    1. Repay your outstanding debt.
    2. Access your collateralized bTokens.
    3. Sell bTokens to repay more debt if necessary.

    You can choose to partially unwind your position or fully exit back to the reserve asset. It's crucial 
    to monitor your position regularly and have a clear exit strategy to manage risk effectively.
