## Coming Soon
Boosting allows borrowers (who have an existing position) to access additional capital after the [BLV](/concepts/blv) has increased. This is possible because the user’s deposited collateral has increased in value due to the BLV increase. Since the lending facility calculates how much can be borrowed based on the BLV of the deposited collateral, the borrowing capacity will have increased. Here is an example to better illustrate this mechanic:

1. **Initial Loan:** A user deposits bTokens as collateral and takes out a loan based on the BLV of those bTokens. For example, if the BLV is $1.00 per bToken, and the user deposits 1000 bTokens, that user can withdraw $1000 in reserve assets.
2. **BLV Increase:** Over time, the market making system accumulates enough capacity to perform a `bump()` operation and increase the BLV from $1.00 to $1.02. This increases the intrinsic value of the collateral. 
3. **Boosting Opportunity:** Because the value of the collateral has increased, the user’s position now has more borrowing power. The new borrowing capacity on the position is now $1020, a $20 increase from $1000. The Boost value is therefore $20 of additional capital that can be borrowed.
