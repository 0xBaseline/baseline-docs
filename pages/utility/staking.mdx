## Baseline Fee Share

Baseline now supports fee sharing, allowing holders to stake, borrow, or loop to earn fees. Stakers receive rewards 
from the system’s market making fees, distributed proportionally among all stakers based on their deposited amount.

There are no restrictions on staking— users can stake any amount and unstake at any time. Staked tokens are not 
liquid and must be unstaked to sell. Rewards are shared among all participants, ensuring fair distribution based on 
contribution. Rewards are streamed per second, and can be claimed at any time. Staking offers a simple way to earn 
from the system while maintaining full flexibility.
