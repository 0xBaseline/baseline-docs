## The Baseline Afterburner

While most of the focus around tokenomics so far has been on Baseline's built-in protections 
against downside volatility, it's important to emphasize that bTokens have value beyond just 
their BLV: in fact, bTokens should expect to trade at a market value above the floor price. 


This 'premium'—the ratio of market price to BLV—is how bTokens generate additional market value 
beyond the liquidity in the pool, creating a net wealth effect for bToken holders. As 
such, sustaining a healthy market premium is equally as important to bTokens as growing the BLV. 
To facilitate this, Baseline comes with another system: the **Afterburner**.

### Capital Efficiency

One key feature of Baseline is the ability to borrow a bToken's underlying BLV value by using it as collateral.
The Afterburner also takes advantage of this feature, using any purchased bTokens to borrow more liquidity
for an even more impactful buyback. To optimize for capital efficiency, the Afterburner fires a larger 
portion of funds at lower premiums, allowing the protocol to not only buy tokens at a cheaper price, but also 
take advantage of the cheap leverage offered by the system.

This is because the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio increases as a bToken trades closer to its floor price, naturally 
increasing the system's available leverage. For instance, at a 10% premium, Baseline offers 90% LTV on loans, 
enabling the Afterburner to execute buybacks with 10x leverage. In this case, a $20,000 leveraged buyback would 
transform into $200,000 market bids, allowing this strategy to maximize its impact on the bToken's market value.

### Guaranteed Buy Pressure

The Afterburner conducts periodic leveraged bids directly on the open market, passively growing a 
bToken's market premium. The Baseline Afterburner 
is financially self-sufficient, using flows generated by Baseline's protocol operations (e.g. trading 
fees from protocol-owned liquidity and interest payments from bToken loans) to finance its buybacks.

The Afterburner runs at all times and under all market conditions, naturally generating market premiums 
even in the absence of external demand. 

### Buyback Execution Strategy

The Afterburner attempts to "fire" at regular intervals, typically every 10-15 minutes. Each attempt 
has a randomly determined probability of success to prevent frontrunning. The initial odds start at 1% 
(1/100) and progressively increase with failed attempts, capping at 3% (1/33). After a successful firing, 
the probability is lowered, allowing the system to "cool off."

The size of the buyback is always a portion of the total accumulated fees and scales based on the bToken's 
market premium. The afterburner uses funds as they come in, but this scaling ensures that some 
funds always remain in the system for future buybacks, allowing the Afterburner to run indefinitely. 

This strategy is designed to release value from accrued fees over a longer period of time, skewing the value 
distribution towards holders with longer time preferences.
